0, Do you meet your target this month?
-1," Yes, thanks God, I can meet the target. But I wonder with NAME. She never meets the target. "
-1, NAME?? She is still very young. I don't think that she can work here for a long time. 
0," Why? By the way, how old is she actually?"
-1," She is working, right? so she must be mature. She's already 24 years old. "
-1, But she is still childish. She is also often sensitive. 
-1, Age has nothing to do with maturity. She should realise that she works. 
-1, Perhaps she doesn't like the job. 
-1," If she doesn't like the job, she must find another job! "
0," She's trying to get another job, but mostly they offered small salary."

0,What's the matter?

-1," Oh, your gum is swollen. How long have you had this pain? "
0, Since yesterday.
0, Did you eat sugary foods?
0, Yes I did. But just little. And I brushed my teeth afterwards.
-1, You have a cavity. Brushing teeth will not help much. Because the germ can come into the cavity and can travel into your other organs. 
0, Should I have a filling?
-1," I think so. But I can't do it now. I'm going to prescribe you. Please take these medicines three times daily with the meal, and come back again after the medicine is finished. "
0, Alright.

0, Do you have a lot of clothes that need to be washed?
0, Is your load big?
-1, My load isn't that big. 
0," If it's a problem, you don't have to do it for me."
1, I can do this for you. Don't worry.
1, I greatly appreciate this.
1, Don't mention it.
0, Could you wash some of my dark clothes with yours?
0, Is there any special care I should take with your clothes?
0, The only thing is that they have to be washed on the gentle cycle.

0," You need to get some rest, as you have to get up early in the morning."
-1, It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now. 
0," Just close your eyes, and try not to think."
-1, That really does not work for me. 
0," It doesn't matter, you need to get some sleep."
0," How about I tire myself out, and then fall asleep when I'm tired?"

-1," You and I have been together for a whole year, and our vacation time should be about the two of us! "

0," Thank you, but no. This will do it for now."
0, Tax brings your total to $32.42. How would you like to pay?
0," Cash, please."
1, Here's your change. Thank you.
0," Hi NAME, this is NAME."
0, Hello NAME. How are things going for you?
1," Great, how are you?"
1, Fine. Everything is just fine.
1," NAME, I had a great time the other night and was wondering if you would like to go out again this weekend."
-1," NAME, I enjoyed your company, but I am getting ready to graduate soon. I really need to focus on my studies. "
0, Maybe I could help you with what you need to get done.
1," It would be better for me to just deal with getting my work done, but thank you for a lovely dinner."
0, Did you have a date Friday night?
0," Yes, in fact, I did."
0, Who did you go out with?
0, A man I met in a coffee shop.
0, Where did you go?
1, We went to a nice restaurant.
0, Anywhere else?
0, Then we went to a jazz club.
1, That sounds like a nice date.
1," Yes, it was pleasant."
-1, But you won't date him again? 
-1," No. He was nice, but there was no chemistry. "
-1, I had the worst date the other night. 
0, What happened?
-1," First of all, he was half an hour late. "
-1, That's not a good start. 
-1, Then he didn't bother to apologize. 
-1, That's rude. 
-1, Then he drove too fast to the restaurant. 
-1, That's dangerous. 
-1, I thought about getting out and taking a taxi home. 
0, What happened at the restaurant?
-1," We had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip! "
-1, I guess you can't go back to that restaurant. 
-1, I don't like that man. 
0, Why not?
-1, He's a dirty old man. 
0, What do you mean?
-1," He's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out. "
0," Well, you can't blame a man for asking."
-1, He should act his age. 
0, Does your girlfriend ever make you angry?
0, Sometimes.
0, What does she do?
1," Just yesterday, I told her I wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world."
1, That was a nice thing to say.
0, That's what I thought.
0, What did she say?
-1, She laughed! She didn't believe me. 
-1, That wasn't very nice of her. 
-1, She said that nothing is more important to me than money. 
0, What did you say?
1, I told her I wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.
0, Some people have good noses.
-1, I wish I had a good nose. Mine is way too big. 
0, I don't mean good looking. I mean good smelling.
-1, Oh. But that can be a curse. 
0," Yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors."
0, I'll say. My girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
0, Did she catch you using drugs?
0, Sort of. She knows whenever I sneak a cigarette.
0, You don't need a good nose for that cigarettes stink.
-1," But when I sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening! "
0," Boy, that is a good nose."
0, I told her she should apply for a job at customs.
-1," NAME, what's wrong? Why do you look so sad? "
-1," Mom, NAME is moving away. "
-1," Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Why is she moving? "
0, Her dad got a job in another state.
0, Where is she moving?
0, To California. That's across the country.
0," There are many ways you can still keep in touch. You can e-mail, text, and call each other on the phone."
-1, But it won't be the same as seeing each other every day. She is my best friend. I'm going to miss her. 
0, I know you will. When are they moving?
0, At the end of June when the school year ends. In two months.
0, Would you like to invite her over this weekend? You can have a sleepover.
1," Yes, please. That would be great. We're going to try to hang out as much as possible before she moves."
1, That sounds like a good plan.
1," Yes, it is a good plan!"
0, Hi NAME. Our daughter is graduating from college this week.
1," That's wonderful, NAME! What did she study?"
0, Nursing.
1, That's a great field. My mom was a nurse.
0, My mother was a nurse too.
1, She must be so proud of her.
1," Yeah, she is. We are all proud of her."
0, Does she want to work in a hospital?
0, Yeah. She got a job at the hospital already.
1, That's great!
0, Are you doing anything special to celebrate?
1, We bought her a new car.
1, Wow! That's an awesome gift!

0, What is she going to do for a month?
0, She's going backpacking with a friend in Europe.

1, Yes. We love it. She's the goalie. She's really good.
0, How long has she been playing?
0, Seven years. She wants to get a scholarship to college.
1," She's a smart girl! Did you play soccer, too?"
1," I played a couple of years in high school, but she is much better than I was."
-1, This job is going nowhere. 
0, What do you want to do?
0, I need to expand my contacts and meet new people.
0, I think more companies are hiring now.
0, What's the best way to network?
0, Volunteer at organizations and attend the company events. You'll meet lots of people in the same industry.
1, Good idea!
0, Can you tell me where the pots and pans are?
0, Pots and pans are right over there.
1," Oh, thank you."
0, Could I interest you in our store credit card?

-1, I have a very difficult customer on the phone. 
0, What is the problem?
0, The customer wants a full refund on something she purchased over a year ago.
0, We only give a refund within 30 days of purchase.
-1," I explained that to her, but she is demanding a refund. "
0, Is the product broken?
0, Yes. I told her she needs to contact the manufacturer.
0, What did she say about that?
-1, She is refusing to call the manufacturer because she doesn't have a warranty. 
0, I will talk to her. Transfer the call to me.
-1," Hey, B. This is A. My flight has been delayed. I won't be there on time. "
0, I guess I'll have to do the presentation alone.
0, Are you prepared to do that?
-1, I have no choice. 
0, Can we postpone the meeting?
-1, No. The clients are catching a flight right after the meeting.

0, Don't you want to know as soon as something happens?
-1, The news is too scary. 
0, Why is it scary?
-1," They only talk about bad things like crime, accidents, and earthquakes. "
0, I need to lose weight.
0, I've been on a no sugar diet.
0, How is that going?

0, Again? We went there last weekend.
0, That's right. Remember we go every Sunday evening.

0, I'm a single dad. I need to take my son to school by 8 AM. Would I be able to start at 9?
-1, 9 AM is a little late for our company. This may be a problem. 
-1, Please consider my situation. It's hard to be a single dad and have a career. 
0," B, I completely understand. I'm a single parent too."
0, You are?
0, Yes. So I will discuss it with the other managers and ask them to let you start at 9 AM.
1, Thank you so much! I look forward to hearing from you.
-1, I'm sick and tired of fixing the dishwasher.

-1, I'm sorry. I promise to keep the apartment clean. 
0, Why don't we divide the housework?
0, Ok. How do you want to divide it?
0," We will clean up our own messes. Then, we will take turns cleaning the common areas."
0, What are the common areas?
0," Places that we use together, like the bathroom, kitchen, and living room."
0, That sounds fair.
0, Do you remember our 10th birthday?

1, Cats are cute and cuddly.
1, Dogs are cute and cuddly too.

0, I ran a red light?
0," Yes, you did."

0, I'll give you an application form when I see you.
1, That sounds good. Do I need to bring anything?

0, Tell me what happened.
-1," The officer says that I ran a red light, but I didn't. "
-1, The officer wouldn't lie about that. 
0," He must've, because the signal had a camera on top of it."
0, There was no picture taken of your license plate?
0, I don't believe it took my picture.
0, I'm just going to let you go.
1, I appreciate that.
0, I need to pay the fine on my ticket.
0, Do you have the ticket with you?
0," Yes, I have my ticket with me."
0, Let me see your ID.
0, I forgot to bring that with me.
0, You need it to pay your fine.
-1, Why can't I just give you the money for the fine? 
0," Because, I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are."

0," All right, come back and bring your ID."
0, Could I pay for my parking ticket?

0, I'm going to look around and see how bad the damage is.
-1, Be careful. There could be aftershocks. 
0, I know. Don't go outside. The power is down. There could be power lines on the ground.
0, Ok. Where are the dogs?
0, I found them. They're both under the bed.
-1, They must be scared. 
0, I wish we could watch the news. I want to know how much damage this earthquake caused.

0, Not when you're hungry.
-1," B, where are the cookies? Don't tell me you ate them all! Again! "
1," Yes, I did. I couldn't help it. They were so good."
-1, I thought you didn't like cookies. 
1," Well, I don't like cookies flavored with chocolate at all. But vanilla is different. I love them to death."
0," Huh, I didn't know that."
1," Well, tell you what, vanilla cookies taste even better with a glass of cold milk."
0, Are you ready to order now?
0," Yes. I'll have some salad, roast beef, and mashed potatoes."

0, Is there anything else?
0," One orange juice. Make it small, please."
0," B, can you do me a favor? Can you help me cut this chicken?"

0," I would like half of it cut into slices, and the other half diced."
0, OK. Half sliced and the other half diced.
0," Oh, by the way, I want it to be very, very lean. Not even a shred of fat."
0, Got'cha. Cut off the fat.
0," How often do you eat out, B?"
0," Well, very often. I eat out almost five times a week."
1," Wow, I really envy you.Â"
-1," Don't envy me. It's for business. In fact, I'm sick and tired of restaurant food. Sometimes I just want a home cooked meal. "
0, Pompas. How may I help you?
0, Yes. I'd like to reserve a table for dinner.
0, How large a group are you expecting?
0, Six couples.

0, Next time lunch is on me.
1, Don't be silly.
1, I'm serious.
1, All right. Next time you'll treat.
0," Let's eat out, shall we?"

1, Don't worry about it. It's my treat.
1, You're sure? You're so generous!
1," And nice, too."
0," So, where are you taking me?"
0, A's Kitchen.
0," You're going to miss your sister since she's married, aren't you?"
1," I sure am. She made a lovely bride, didn't she?"
1, She was beautiful. So when will your turn be?
1, Soon! Very soon!
1," Well, a drink to you and your future wife!"
0, Did you see our last electric bill?
0, No. Was it high?
-1, It was very high. 
0, I think it's the air conditioner.
-1, We need to keep it off. 
-1, But it's so hot these days. 
0, I need to make an emergency trip to our headquarters tonight.

0, Get it.
1, Thanks.
0, What's going on between you and NAME? Did you guys have a fight or something?
-1, I can't stand him any more! He has such a short fuse that even a little piece of friendly advice sets him off. 
0, So what did you tell him?
-1," I told him that if he could be more patient and try not to lose his temper so easily, he would be more popular. "
-1, No wonder he threw a fit. His popularity is really a sore spot. 
-1," Well, I guess I'll just keep my mouth shut. That'll teach me to give advice! "
-1, Not unless you want to die! 
-1," B, can you do the dishes tonight? I'm very tired. "
-1," Can't we just put them in the dish washer? I've had a very bad day, too! I just want to kick back and relax. "
-1, Hey! Just because you had a bad day today doesn't give you permission to take it out on me! 
-1," Just leave me alone, OK! "
-1, Why are you being such a turd! I wish I hadn't gotten married! 
-1, You look so angry. What happened? 
-1, Nothing. I'd rather not talk about it. Just don't ask. 
-1," Come on. I think you need to let off some steam. Besides, you shouldn't keep your feelings pent up. They'll eat you alive. So, talk to me. "
-1," All right. This morning I took my car to the garage to have them check the air-conditioner. They only gave it a once-over, refilled it with some Freon, and charged me 300 bucks! "
-1," No wonder you're livid. I'd be mad, too if someone ripped me off like that. "
-1," Yeah. AND they were rude. They said I didn't know anything about cars, which I don't, but they didn't have to be so blunt! "
-1, Sounds like you got a raw deal! Maybe you should file a complaint with the Consumer Protection Agency. 
-1, You look like you're fuming. What's going on? 
-1," The boss is being unreasonable! He flared up at me, making a mountain out of molehill! "
0, What's the molehill he made a mountain out of?
-1," I only made a few more copies, and I didn't think it was any big deal, but he blew up at me! "
-1," Well, he has been under a lot of pressure recently. The company has been losing money and he's been a little bit depressed. "
-1," Well, I know he has the blues, but it doesn't mean he can vent his anger on me. "
-1," What happened just now, B? You werne't very kind when you were talking with NAME. What do you have against him? "
-1, I just don't like him at all. 
0, Why? Is there something in particular?
-1," Well, he has such a mean streak in him! I went to his office to ask him for some help, and he simply turned up his nose at me! I was so angry that I wanted to slap him! He wasn't like that before he got the job. Now he's such a snob! "
0, You want my advice? Let it go.
-1," Of course, logically I know you're right, but somehow I just can't bring myself to forget it. Even the mention of his name starts me fuming. "

0," Well, you still have time to cram things into your brain anyway."
-1, Ouch! This tooth is really bugging me.

1, Everything that you need for a successful job search is here. Happy job searching!

1," You need to make sure you arrive on time, smile, be pleasant and friendly, look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability. You'll do great!"
-1, I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview. 
0, Make sure that you understand the company. Do you understand what it is that they do?
0," No, I probably need to do some more research."
0, When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed. Does that make sense?

-1, I have absolutely nothing so far. 
0," I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it, but can we talk about other basics?"
0," Yes, where should we go from here?"
1," Focus on being relaxed and open, don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about. I'm sure you'll do well."
0, What should I do to prepare for a job interview?
0, An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential. Do you have that?
0," Sort of, but I could know more, I guess."
0," With that understanding, you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude. Right?"
0, I think that they are a very formal company.
0, What you wear is important. So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing. Need help?

0," Well, once you get one off the shelf over there, you first put your name on it. OK?"

0, Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week. Do you know how to use military time?
-1," No, I don't know what that is. "
0," OK, so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it. Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes. OK?"
0," Yes, I understand how to do this."
0," After you total your hours, make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor."
1, That was easy!
0, Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on.
0, Am I right in thinking that this dress is on sale?
-1, I'm sorry. You're one day too late for the sale. 
-1, Couldn't you still sell it today at the sale price? 
-1, I'm sorry. One day can make a big difference sometimes. 
0, No problem. Other stores are having sales. I'll check them out.
0," Before you go, let me show you some other dresses that are on sale."
0, How do we do timesheets here?
0, They are actually fairly straightforward. Do you know where the blanks are kept?
0," Yes, I already have one."
0," OK, well after you take one out of that second drawer, you put your name on the top. Do you see?"
-1, I am kind of confused. 
0, Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them. Do you know how to show time on a 24-hour clock?
0, I'm not quite sure.
0," Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in, make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes. Do you understand?"
-1," No, I have no idea what you are talking about. "
0," It's easy, just write in the hours, total it, sign it, and put it in the box."
1, Thanks for your help.
0," Try it and if you can't do it, one of us can always help you later."
0, I need help with my timesheet.
0," OK, no problem. Have you found the blank ones?"
0," Yes, I have seen them."
0," Yes, well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website. OK?"
0," Yes, I understand what to do."
0, You fill in the hours and total them for the week. Have you ever used a 24 hour clock?
0, What? Huh?
0," So after you noted the hours, starting at zero which is midnight, you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes. Get it?"
0, Huh? What?
0," Just make sure you show your total, sign it, and turn it in."
1, This was easy.
0, You are a quick learner. I don't think you'll have any trouble with this.
0, I need help figuring out how to use this phone.
0, Sure. First you pick up the receiver and hit one of the first 3 buttons. Do you hear a tone?
0," Yes, I hear the tone."
0, OK. Now you dial 9 on the keypad. Do you hear the tone change?
0," Yes, it changed."
0," Well, when you hear it change, that means you have an outside line. Where are you trying to call?"
0, I am trying to call home.
0," OK. Well, to dial to the outside you just now dial the number. For a call inside the company just hit the extension number. Do you know the extensions?"
0," Yes, I have a list of extensions."
0," Well, if you ever need help with an extension, you can dial O."
0, Can you show me how to use this phone?
0," Yes, I can help you with that. Pick up the receiver and hit one of the buttons. Do you hear a tone?"
0," No, I don't hear anything."
0, Next you dial 9 on the keypad. You should hear the tone change. Did you hear it change?
0, I'm not sure.
0," OK. Well, after you get the line to change you have an outside line. Who are you trying to call?"
0, I am trying to call a client.
0," To call a number on the outside you now just dial the number. For inside calls, punch in the extension number. Has someone given you an extension list?"
0," No, I don't know anyone's extension."
0, All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help.
0, I want to make a phone call. Can you show me how?
0," Of course, pick up the receiver, hit a button and listen for a tone. Are you hearing it?"
0," Yes, now what do I do?"
0," Well, after you dial 9 on the keypad, you should hear the tone change."
0," No, nothing changed."
0, When you dial 9 and hear the tone change it means you have an outside line. Who are you trying to call?
0, I am trying to call my boss.
0, For an outside call you now just dial the number. For a company number you need to know the extension. Do you have a list of extensions?
0, I know a few extensions but I don't know all of them.
0, You can always look an extension up on the company website.
0, I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting.
0," Of course, I have Monday or Tuesday available. What day would be best for you?"
0, I would like to meet on Monday.
0, Very well then. Are mornings or afternoons best?
0, I want to come in the morning.
0, I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time. Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come?
0," Yes, I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting."
0, Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee?
0, I think that we should have just the sub-committee.
0," OK then, I will make the arrangements for them to attend. Do you know how to get there?"
0," No, I need directions, please."
0," Fine, we will make sure that we send you all of the information that you need."
0, Could I meet with you to discuss the project?
0, Good idea. We could meet on Monday or Tuesday. Which day would you prefer?
1, Tuesday would be good for me.
0, OK. Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon?
1, I think the afternoon would be best.
0, That will work out. I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow. I need you to bring your plans with you.
0," Yes, I will bring my plans with me to the meeting."
0, Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there?
0, I feel that the whole committee needs to be there.
0," Yes, I agree. We'll make sure that they get notified. Can you find the meeting place?"
0," Yes, I know how to get there on my own."
1, Great! We will send you all the details later. Looking forward to meeting with you!
0, When could we meet to discuss the project?
0, I will be available on Monday or Tuesday. Choose which day is best for you.
0, I prefer Monday.
0, Good. Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best?
1, Either one is OK.
1," Great! When I check with the others, I will send you an exact time. When you come, be prepared to do your presentation."
0, I will be prepared to do my presentation.
0, Who would you like to see there? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee?
0, Everyone needs to be there.
0, That will probably be best. Do you need help with directions?
0, I think I know where it is. Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure.
1, OK. We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow. Have a good day!
0, I had an appointment tomorrow and I need to change it to a different date.
0," Certainly, what day would be best for you?"
0, I think that Monday or Tuesday would be good for me.
0, I can give you Monday; I have ten or eleven in the morning.
1, I think ten o'clock is best.
0," Fine, I'll put you down for that."
1, That would be great!
1, Happy I could help you; see you then!
0, I was wondering if I could reschedule my appointment to a later date?
0," OK, just tell me what day would be best for your appointment."
1, Wednesday or Thursday would be perfect.
0, Thursday is available; would ten or eleven be best?
1, I would love to have an eleven o'clock appointment.
1," Great, I'll just add you in, if that works."
1," Perfect, I appreciate that."
1, So happy that we had an opening for you.
-1," Am I mistaken, or is this dress on sale? "
-1, I'm very sorry. The sale ended yesterday. 
1," I really like this dress, but I want to pay the sale price."
1," If you like, I can put you on our mailing list for the next sale."
1," That's okay. Some days you win, some days you lose."
1, Let me ask my manager when he thinks this dress will be on sale again.
-1, I can't make my appointment and need to make another one. 
0," That's OK, we can reschedule it if you tell me what day works for you."
1," Friday, Saturday, or Sunday would be good for me."
0, I can give you Friday; would you prefer ten or eleven?
1, Ten o'clock is perfect.
0," Well, in that case, I'll just write you in."
1, Thanks. That will work out well.
1, It was my pleasure to have been able to make it work.
-1, Sorry for being late to work. 
0, Where have you been?
-1, My car broke down. 
-1, That's too bad. Please try to fix it so that it doesn't happen again. 
0," Yes, I'll work on it."
1," Thank you, have a seat. We are working on the new project"
1, Great! Fill me in.
0, Let's take a look at the Campbell Project.
0, I don't understand the projected revenues.
0, Let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand.
-1, I am sorry I am so late to work. 
0, What was the problem?
-1, I lost track of time. 
0, Things happen; make sure it doesn't become a habit.
0, It won't happen again.
0," All right, please take this message and call this client."
0, No problem.
0, Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board?
0," Yes, I understand the numbers."
0, I will explain it again; especially for those of you who arrived late.
0," I lost track of time, am I late?"
0, Yes. What kept you from arriving on time?
0, My friend needed me to help him.
0, I realize that everyone has emergencies; just get here on time from now on.
-1, My apologies. 
1, I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting.
0," Sure, I'll sit right here."
1," Wonderful, does anyone have any questions about this project?"
-1, I am confused about the projected revenues. 
1," I'm glad that some of you get it, but let's go over it once more."
0," So tell me again, why couldn't you get the supplies I ordered?"
0," Well I ordered them when you asked, but the supplier said they might need to back order them."
0, When do you think they will finally arrive?
0, I think maybe by Tuesday.
0," If they don't arrive by then, what are our options?"
0, I could try another supplier down the street.
0, That would work for me.
0," OK, I will stay on it and let you know how it's going."
1, Thank you for taking care of the problem.
1, Thank you for your business. We appreciate you as a client.
-1, You promised me the supplies would be in today and now you say they aren't here? 
0," They said they had part of the order, but the rest won't be available until later."
0," I guess that's it then, when will you be able to get the rest?"
-1, I am not sure. 
-1," I am not convinced that will work for me, what now? "
0, I could order them from another supplier as a back-up.
1, That is a good plan.
1, Good! I will call you later this afternoon and let you know when your supplies will arrive.
1, I appreciate you staying on it.
1, We appreciate your business and aim to please.
-1, I really needed the supplies today and you are telling me you don't have them now? 
0, The supplier said that it will be a few more days until they can ship the order.
0," Fine, what day will the whole order be here?"
0," If we are lucky, they may get here tomorrow."
0, Is there anywhere else we can get these supplies?
0, Let's order the missing items from someone else just to be sure.
1, I appreciate that suggestion.
0, I will track your order on the internet and e-mail you the moment it arrives.
1, I look forward to hearing from you.
0, Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you in the meantime.
0, What does she look like?
-1," Well, she was pretty tall, about 5 feet 10 inches and kind of scary looking! "
0," What do you mean, scary?"
-1," Well, she had a crazy sounding laugh and wild hair. Do you know what I mean? "
0," Yes, I know what you mean."
-1, And her piercing eyes! She looked like an alien who just came down from outer space. Do you believe that people from outer space live amongst us? 
-1," No, that's impossible! "
0," Unless they beam us up for a ride, we will never know for sure. Have you ever thought that you saw a flying saucer?"
-1, Are you crazy? 
0," Hah, I guess we never know what can happen. Do you like Star Wars movies?"
0," Yes, I have seen all of the Star Wars movies."
1, I loved Star Wars movies. My favorite character was NAME. What about you?
1, I liked NAME.
1," Yeah, that character was pretty cool. If you had to describe that character, what would you say about them?"
1, They were very beautiful.
1," Yeah, I know what you mean!"
0, Can you describe her for me?
-1," She was large, hairy, and scary! "
0, What are you talking about?
-1," When she laughed, it sent chills up my spine. Have you ever met someone like that? "
0," Yes, one time I met someone like that."
-1, She had eyes like laser beams. Sometimes I wonder if aliens from UFOs live here with us. Do you think that's possible? 
0," Sure, I think it could happen."
0, I guess it's impossible to say for sure unless you go for a ride in one. Do you think that would be an interesting experience?
-1," No, I never want to be near a UFO! "
0," Well, you will probably never see one. Have you seen any Star Wars movies?"
0," No, I haven't seen any Star Wars movies."
1, Star Wars was the best. I really like NAME. Do you have a favorite character?
0, I like NAME.
0," Oh yeah, I forgot about that character! What words do you think would best describe that character?"
0, He looked like a black vacuum cleaner.
1, I totally agree!
0, How does she look?
-1, I am not sure how tall she was but she was very scary! 
0, Is this a joke?
-1," Oh my god, you should have seen her! She looked like she had just crawled out from underneath something. Do you get what I am saying? "
-1," No, I have no idea what you are talking about. "
-1," Oh man, her eyes were the most incredible glowing green. She might be a Martian or something. Do you think that is possible? "
0," Yes, I believe in UFOs."
0, I've never seen a UFO but I would like to. How about you?
1," Yes, I think that seeing a UFO would be fascinating."
1," Personally, I've never seen one. I think is would be fun to see the universe like in a Star Wars movie. Have you seen the Star Wars movies?"
0, I saw some of them.
1, I loved the special effects and the story. I like Princess NAME. Who did you like the best?
1, I like NAME.
1," Yes, that is a good choice. How would you describe that character if you had to tell someone what they looked like?"
1, He was hot!
1, That's a really good description.
0," Hello, I was wondering if I could talk with the apartment manager."
0, I am the apartment manager. How can I help you?
0, I was wondering if the apartment on Main Street is still available.
1," Yes, it's still vacant. Are you interested in seeing it?"
1," Yes, I would love to see the apartment."
0, I will be at the apartment today at 6:00. Can you make it?
1," Yes, I can be there at 6."
1, Great. I'll see you at 6. Do you know where it is?
1," Yes, I have a friend who lives in that neighborhood."
0, I'll be bringing an application form.
1," OK, should I bring anything with me?"
1," No. I might need to see your ID card, but that's about it."
1, I'm glad these batteries are on sale.
-1, I'm sorry. These batteries are not on sale. 
-1, But that's what the ad says. 
-1," I'm sorry. If you look at the ad again, you'll see that the other brand is on sale. "
-1, You're right. I misread the ad. 
-1," Yes, many people make that mistake. "
-1, You can't blame them. It's a confusing ad. 
1, You're right. Many ads are like that.
0, As long as I'm here.
1," Just one second, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale."
0, I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend.
0," Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser?"
0, It is in the park downtown.
0, Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday?
0, We will need it for Saturday only.
0, I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it?
0, NAME and I will be driving the van.
0, Could you drop it off on Sunday night?
0," Yes, we can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also?"
0," Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van, if possible."
0, I would need to check on that. Where is the fundraiser?
0, It will be at the beach by the pier.
0, What day will you need it for?
0, We will only be needing it for Sunday.
0, Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it.
0, The only two drivers will be NAME and I.
0," If I give you the keys to the garage, could you bring it back on Sunday evening?"
0, Sure. We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom. Would that be OK?
0," OK, but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest."
0, Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend?
0, That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place?
0, It is in the hotel ballroom down the street.
0, Do you need it for the whole weekend?
0, We will need it for both days.
0, We will need to know who will be driving the van.
0, The van will be driven by NAME and me.
0, It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that?
0," Yes, no problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom?"
0, Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening.
0, I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains.
1," I agree, I think that that would be perfect!"
0, I was thinking it could take place sometime in January.
0, That might be a little too cold for some people.
0," Yes, you are right."
1, What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot.
1," Yes, that would work out better."
0," You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone."
1, Good idea! We'll have to get right on it.
1," Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!"
0, I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year.
1, What a great idea!
1, January would be a good month for a mountain retreat.
-1," I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January. "
0," You know, now that I think about it, you might be right."
1, April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements.
1, That is a good suggestion.
0, We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them.
0," Yes, that would let us know what would work best."
0, I'll put the survey online this afternoon.
1, The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat.
1, That's a wonderful choice.
0, I have chosen January as the month for this retreat.
0, January is a little too close to the NAME holidays.
0," Yes, maybe another choice might be better."
1, I think that April would work. Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains.
1, Thank you for thinking of that.
0, Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer.
1, That is a good idea.
0, I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers.
0, I was thinking about applying for the new position.
0, Do you think that is a good idea?
0, It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure.
0, What are your main concerns?
0," It would give me a chance to grow, but I am wondering if I would like the job."
0," I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself."
0, I also am thinking about the pay.
0, Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward?
0," Yes, it might be worth it. But I am not certain."
1, I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you.
0," I am not certain, but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job."
0, Why are you considering trying for it?
0," I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it."
0, What is it about this job that appeals to you?
0, I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved.
0," Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider."
0, I am also wondering about the pay.
0, Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?
0, I am thinking that might be the case.
0, I think you should give it a shot. What do you have to lose? You can always change your mind.
0, I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday.
0, Are you certain that that is what you want to do.
0," It may not be the best choice for me, but I am considering it."
0, Why do you think that this would be a good move?
0, I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me.
0," Yes, there are always pros and cons to making a career change."
0," Also, the matter of pay is also a consideration."
1, I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it. The benefits are much better.
1," Yes, sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice."
1, I think you definitely should apply for the position.
1," Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices!"
0," Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite?"
1, I love anything with chocolate the best.
1, I like chocolate myself.
0, Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?
-1, I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it. 
0, I haven't ever cared for that myself.
0, Have you ever had garlic ice cream?
-1, That sounds absolutely disgusting! 
0," It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though."
1, OK.
0, It's about time these batteries went on sale.
-1, I'm sorry. These aren't on sale today. 
-1, You're kidding me. The ad says they're on sale. 
1," Yes, the other brand of batteries is on sale."
-1, I see. I've got the wrong brand. 
-1," Yes, it's an easy mistake to make. "
-1, The ad is written in a misleading way. 
-1, I agree. It seems like all ads are meant to confuse you. 
-1, It's not the first or last time. 
0," Hold on, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale."
1, There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from!
0," Yes, there must be about a hundred. Do you have a favorite?"
1, I love fruit flavored ices the best.
1," Yes, fresh fruit flavored is the best ever."
0, What is your least favorite ice cream?
-1, I don't like peppermint ice cream. 
0," Yes, I know what you mean."
0," One time, I tried garlic ice cream."
1, That could be interesting.
1, That doesn't sound like a good choice for today. Let's order!
1, I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place!
0, There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite?
1, Vanilla with toppings is my favorite.
0, Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae?
-1, No way! 
-1, I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it. 
0," I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me."
0, I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once.
-1, I think that that would be horrible! 
1, I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today!
1, I agree with you. I like strawberry ice cream.
0, I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday.
1, I could help you with that.
0, Are you sure you have the time?
0," I promise you that I have the time to do this. If I didn't, I wouldn't offer to help."
0, What would be the best time for you to help me?
0, Tomorrow night would work for me.
0, Should we just meet here?
0," OK, and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation."
0, I'll see you then.
0, See you tomorrow night.
0, Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday?
1, I would love to help you prepare for your presentation.
-1, I hate to ask you to do something like that. 
1, This will not interfere with my work. I promise you that.
0, When could we get together?
0, I could easily give you some time tomorrow night.
0, Would you like to meet at the coffee house next door?
0," Yes, and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with?"
0, I'll come prepared.
1, Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet.
-1, I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday. 
1," If you would like me to, I could help you with that."
0, Wouldn't that take you away from your project?
1, I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me.
0, Is there a good time for you to help me?
0," If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready for Friday."
0, How about meeting in my office?
1, That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have.
1, Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot.
1, Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise!
0, What are you doing after work?
0, I have to take our clients out to dinner.
0, Where are you going to take them?
0, I don't know. Do you have any suggestions?
1, There's a really good sushi place downtown.
0, The new one on Main Street?
0," Yeah, that's the one."
0, I can't take them there.
0, Why?
0, Our clients own it.
0, Did you see Titanic?
1, Yes. It is a great movie.
0, I saw it twelve times.
0, I saw it eight times.
0, I have the DVD.
0, So do I.
0, Let's go to your home.
0, We can watch my DVD.
0, And then we can go to my home.
0, And watch your DVD.
0, I always cry at the end.
0, Me too.
0, Let's play cards.
0, I don't know any card games.
0, I'll teach you one.
0, Okay. What will you teach me?
0, It's called poker.
0, Is it easy to learn?
0," Yes, it will only take about 30 minutes."
0, Okay. Teach me how to play.
0, We each get five cards.
0," Oh, look. I have four tens."
0," That's great, but you're not supposed to tell me."
0," Oh. Okay, I don't have four tens."
1, I'm a good card player.
0, Why is that?
0, Because I watch the other players.
0, What do you mean?
0, People will tell you if they have a good hand.
0, How do they do that?
0," For example, a friend of mine licks his lips."
0," When he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?"
0," I know he has a good hand, so I don't bet."
0, He never wins your money?
-1," Nope, and it drives him crazy. "
0, He knows you can't read his mind. Maybe he thinks you're cheating.
0," Turn the radio down, please."
-1, But I'm listening to it. 
0," Well, listen to it more quietly."
0, I can't wait till I grow up.
0, What will you do?
0, I will play the radio as loud as I want.
0, That's okay with me.
0, I will have a radio in every room of my house.
-1, Remind me to never visit you. 
-1, All the radios will be on extra loud. 
-1, Your neighbors will hate you. 
-1," If they don't like it, they can move. "
-1, You don't often find these batteries on sale. 
-1, I'm not sure that these batteries are on sale today. 
0, But the ad says they're on sale.
-1," Yes, batteries are on sale, but not this brand. "
-1, What do you know? I picked up the wrong brand. 
-1," Yes, several customers have made that mistake today. "
-1," Like many ads, it's deliberately confusing. "
1," Yes, I couldn't agree more. They write ads just to get you into the store."
-1, I should know better by now. 
1," If you can wait one minute, I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale."
1, I hope I win the lotto.

0, It got rained out.
0, Rained out?
0," Yes, rained out."
0, How could that be?
0," Well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm."
0, I thought they were playing under a dome.
0, The dome doesn't close.
0, Why doesn't it close?
0, Who knows? They said they'll fix it before next season.
0, Can I try your coffee?
0, Sure. Here you go.
1," Hmm, that's not bad."
0, There's nothing in it.
0, What do you mean?
0," I mean, it's just coffee."
0, I figured that.
0, It's not too bitter for you?
1," It's a little bitter, but it's okay."
0, There's no sugar or cream in it.
0," No, it's a taste you have to get used to."
0, Sort of like beer.
0, Let's take a walk.
0, What's the weather like?
0, Let me step outside and see.
0," It's a little chilly, right?"
0," Yes, it is."
0, I'll put on my cap.
0," Wear a jacket, too."
0, I wonder if I should bring my gloves.
0," Maybe you should, just in case it gets colder."
0, I'll put a glove in each pocket.
0, We'll get warmer as we walk.
0," Yes, but it gets colder as the sun goes down."
0, Look at the car chase on TV!
-1, That driver is crazy. 
-1, I can't believe he hasn't crashed. 
0, How fast is he going?
0, They say he's going 80 miles per hour.
-1, He's going to kill someone. 
-1, Look! He just hit that car. 
-1," Oh, my goodness. No one is safe on the streets. "
0, Now he's slowing down.
0, Maybe he ran out of gas.
-1, Look! He just got out of the car and started running. 
0, I hope the police catch him.
-1, TV news is so stupid.

0, Last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
0, Yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
0, Last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
0, Last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.
0, The weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.
0, The sports guy shows us players fighting.
0, They always tell us what's next.
-1," They always make what's next sound exciting, but it never is. "
-1, It's more like news for kids. 
-1, They should have kid reporters. 
1, I love my computer.
1, Computers are so cool.
1, I love to go online.
1, The Internet is amazing.
1, You can travel all over the world.
0, I know. I went to China yesterday.
0, What did you do?
0, I stood on the Great Wall and looked all around.
0, What was it like?
1, It was like the real thing.
0, It was like being there?
1," Yes, I felt like I was actually there."
1," Oh, that is great!"
1, The Beatles are the best.
1, They are the best musical group ever.
1, I love all their songs.

1, This is the first time I've seen these batteries on sale.
-1," I'm sorry, but they aren't on sale today. "
-1, Look at the ad. The ad says they're on sale. 
0," Yes, the ad says that the other brand of batteries is on sale."
-1," Yes, I misread the ad. "
0," Believe me, you're not the first person to make that mistake today."
-1," No wonder people make a mistake. The price is in big letters, and the brand is in tiny letters. "
0, You're right. You have to read an ad two or three times sometimes.
-1, You have to be careful with every ad you read. 
1, It's okay. I'll go get you the batteries that are on sale.
0, They call him Father Dollar NAME.
0," Yes, he was on the TV news today."
0, Every Easter Sunday he gives away money.

0," This year he gave away $15,000."
0, That's a lot of money.
0, He gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.

1," No, today people like lots of action."
1, I like a good story.
1, I like to see actors who are like real people.
0, Like real people with real problems.
0, They still make movies like that.
-1," Yes, but they never make much money. "
0, Do you get PBS on TV?
0," Yes, everybody gets the Public Broadcasting System."
0, It puts me to sleep.
0, Tell me about it.
0, A gardening show follows a knitting show.
0, A cooking show follows a sewing show.
0, A travel show follows another travel show.
-1, I'll say! I've gone around the world a dozen times already! 
0, Now they're adding old TV shows to the old movies.
1, I sure would like to see something interesting for a change.
0," If more people donate money, PBS could offer new shows."
0, Who wants to donate? Public TV should be free.
1, I love to watch Judge NAME.
0, Is that a TV show?
0, Yes. It's on every afternoon.
0, What's so good about it?
1, They have interesting lawsuits.
0, Such as?

0, Was something wrong with the phone?
0, It works only in Canada.
0, Did the seller know that?
0," Yes, and he didn't tell the buyer."
0, I hope Judge NAME made the seller take the phone back.
1, That woman is a very good singer.
0," Yes, but she looks like a man."
0, What difference does it make?
0, Female singers are supposed to be pretty.
0, Singers are supposed to sound good.
1," They should look good, too."
0, There are lots of ugly men singers.
0, Men singers don't have to look good.
0, Then neither do women singers.
-1," Well, I would never buy her CD. "
0, But you would buy her CD if she was pretty?
0, Yes. I would buy all of her CDs.
0, All the TV stations are going to go digital.
0," Yes, that will occur next month."
0, Most of them are already broadcasting in digital.
1, The digital signal is very clear.
-1," Oh, no, it isn't! "
0, What do you mean?
-1, I can't get a single channel. 
0, Do you have a digital TV?
-1, Of course. But I don't have cable. 
0," You don't need to have cable, but you do need a antenna."
0, But I have rabbit ears.
0, Rabbit ears aren't strong enough. Buy a digital antenna.
0, The whole file has been erased.
0, How did that happen?
0, I don't know. Who was the last person working on it?
0, I was the last one to work on it.
0, What did you do to it?
0, Nothing. I saved the file and went home.
0, I knew this would happen.
-1, Are you blaming me for this problem? 
-1, Yes. You always screw up the projects. 
-1, You are so rude. That's why no one wants to work with you. 
0, Can you do me a favor?
0, What is it?
0, Could you take me to the store?
0, Sure. Is there something wrong with your car?
0, Yeah. It's in the shop for repairs.
0, Again? You just got it fixed last month.
0, I know. I need a new car.
0, Do you need a ride anywhere else?
0, How about the bank?
0, Ok. I need to go to the store and the bank too.
1," B, your English is so good now."
0, I've been going to ESL classes at night.
1, I am very impressed.
1, Thank you. I have a question to ask you.
0, Please ask me.
0, Would you like to go on a date?
0," What are you doing, NAME?"
0, My class has to write an essay about where we want to go on our field trip.
1, That sounds like an interesting topic.
0," My class can't decide where we want to go, so our teacher is going to make it a contest."
1, I like that idea. What are the choices?
0, Half of my class wants to go to the museum. The other half wants to go to the zoo.
0, Where do you want to go?
1, I want to go to the zoo because I want to see a lion.
0, Didn't you go to the zoo last year?
1," Yes, but it was so much fun."
1, You may want to try something new this year. The museum is a great place too. You can learn a lot there.
1, I know. But I want to see animals.
0, Ok. It's your choice. The museum is having a display of old airplanes.
1, Airplanes? I really like airplanes too.
0, You have a tough decision.
0, Now I can't decide. I need to really think about it.
0, These batteries should be on sale more often.
-1, I don't think these batteries are on sale. 
1, Look at the ad. It says they're on sale.
0," You're right. Batteries are on sale, but not this brand of batteries."
-1, I didn't pay attention to the brand name. 
-1, Several people have misread that ad already today. 
-1, People make the mistake because the ad is misleading. 
1, I agree with you. Ads can be very tricky.
-1, I don't know when I'll ever learn. 
0, May I help you?
0, Yes. I would like to exchange this sweater for another size.
0, What size do you need?
0, I need a large.
0, Let me see if we have any more.
1, Ok. Thank you.
0, We only have one more in stock.
1, Great! I will take it.
0, Would you like to look at anything else?
0," No, thank you. I would just like to exchange the sweater, please."
0, A lot of young people gave me their business cards at the event yesterday.
0, Did you meet any with good potential?
0, It's hard to say. I told all of them to send me their resumes.
0, Do you think they will?
0, I've already received more than half.
0, You should really take time to read through them.
0, I know. I remember when I was young and looking for jobs.
0, Networking is hard and it can be intimidating.
0, I fully understand what they're going through.
0, Be generous with your time. You may find a gem or two.
0, Can you help me understand this report?
0, Sure. What is the problem?
0, I don't know what these numbers mean.
0, It's explained in the report.
-1, The explanations are not very clear. 
0, I'll try to explain it better for you.
0, Did NAME have her baby?
0, Yes. She's on maternity leave right now.
0, How long will she be gone?
0, Three months.
-1, That's all? That's so short. 
-1, I know. She's sad about it. 
0, Is it paid maternity leave?
0, Yes.
1, That's good.
0, NAME wants to take an extra month of maternity leave.
0, We are going to extend our brand of shoes.
0, What other kinds of shoes are you going to sell?
0, We'd like to do basketball shoes too.
1," Your soccer shoes are very popular, so basketball shoes should be a hit too."
1, That's what we're hoping. We need a new marketing strategy.
1, I'm in Sales and Marketing. I can help you.
1, I know. I was hoping you could help us with some advertising ideas.
1, I would love to. Let's set up a meeting to discuss the details.
1, Great! I will email my team and get back to you as soon as possible.
0, Hi NAME. What are you working on?
0, Hi NAME. I'm doing some extra credit to improve my grade in History class.
0, What grade are you getting right now?
0, C.
0, That's not too bad.
1, It's an average grade. I want to get a better grade.
0, I understand. What is the extra credit homework?
0, I have to write a ten-page essay on my favorite president.
0, Wow. 10 pages is long. When is it due?
0, I have two weeks to finish it.
0, I think you can do it. Have you chosen a president?
0, Yeah. I'm going to do it on NAME.
1, That's a great choice.
0, There's a lot of information here at the library.
0, You can search online too.
0," Yeah, I've checked out some books and printed some information from websites."
0, That should be enough information.
0, I have so much to read and write. I hope I have enough time.
0," Well, I guess it's not supposed to be easy since it's extra credit."
0," Yeah, you're right. I better stop talking and start reading."
-1, I'm failing my English class. 
0, Why?
-1, I don't understand what is going on. 
0, Did you talk to your teacher about it?
-1, She's the problem. 
0, What's the problem?
-1, She speaks too fast. I don't understand what she's saying. 
-1, I can't believe you're on social media again. 
0, I'm reading the news.
0, These people are your friends. They're not reporters.
0, They post what's going on in the news.
-1, That's not real news. 
-1, It's more fun than the news channels. Real news is boring. 
0," What happened, NAME?"
-1, A tree fell during the windstorm and hit my house. 
0, Wow! Is everyone ok?
0," Yes. Luckily, we weren't home at the time."
1," Yes, you are very lucky!"
0, I know. It was the big tree in our yard.
-1, I can't believe it! Will insurance cover the repair costs? 
0, I hope so. I'm waiting for the insurance guy to come right now.
0, What are you going to do? Do you have a place to stay while your house gets fixed?
0," Yeah, we're going to stay at my parents' house. They don't live far from here."
1, That's good!
1," I really liked that tree. It was so big and beautiful. And, now it's in my living room."
1, You're a strong man if you can joke about it.
0," Well, if I don't laugh, I'll cry."
0," NAME, what should we do this weekend?"
0, I don't know. What would you like to do?
0, Should we take the kids camping.
1, That sounds like a fun plan.
0, Do you know what the weather forecast for this weekend?
0, No. I have to check.
1, I think it is supposed to be sunny and clear.
1, That's perfect weather for camping.
0, We can go fishing too.
1, The kids are going to love it.
0, Let's not tell them yet.
0, Why?
0, I need to make a reservation. There may not be space available.
0, Oh yeah. We better think of another option just in case.
0, Yeah. How about going to the beach?
1, That would be fun too.
0, Let me try to make a reservation for camping first.
0, Ok. Here's the number.
0, I would like to exchange this dress.
1, You can exchange this dress with anything of the same value.
0, Is there anything on sale today?
-1, I'm sorry. There are no sales today. 
0, Are dresses going to be on sale?
1, Everything's going to be on sale next weekend.
1, That's great. I'll wait. See you next weekend.
1, Okay. I'll see you then.
0," Mom, are we having a big party tonight?"
0," Yes, NAME. All of our relatives are coming. Did you forget?"
0, Oh yeah. It's our annual family reunion.
0, How could you forget? We have a big party every year. This year it is at our house.
1, I remember it was at Uncle NAME's house last year. That was fun.
0, Do you need any help?
0, Yes. Could you please go to the store and buy some ice?
0, I made some lemonade and I want to keep it cold during the party.
1, That's a good idea. It's going to be hot today.
1, I hope the food stays fresh.
1, I'm sure it will be fine. What are you making?
0, It's going to be a potluck. I am serving barbeque ribs and potatoes.
0, Do you know what other people are bringing.
0," I think some people are going to bring salads, appetizers, and desserts."
1, Sounds like a feast.
0," I think everyone is coming, except Aunt NAME. She's feeling sick today."
-1, That's too bad. She is my favorite aunt. 
1, I know. She's my favorite sister.
1, I can't wait to see all of my cousins.
1," They're excited to see you too. But right now, please go buy some ice."
0, Hi NAME. Why are you taking all of your books home?
0, Hey NAME. I won't be in school next week. My family is going on vacation.
0, Where are you going?
0," To Disneyland, the amusement park in California."
1, I know where it is. I've been there before. It's a fun place.
1, This will be my first trip. I'm excited.
1, There are a lot of fun roller coasters to ride on.
0, My mom can't go on them. She has motion sickness.
0, That's too bad. But why are you taking your school books home?
0," I'm going to miss one week of school, so I need to do homework while I'm there."
0, You're going to do homework on vacation?
0, Yeah. I don't want to be behind in class.
1, You're a good student.
0," Well, my parents are making me bring my books."
1," She's really pretty, isn't she? Her skin looks so baby smooth!"
-1," Well, it's just that she puts lots of make-up on her face. Actually, natural beauty comes from within. "
-1," Ah, I can smell jealousy in the air! "
-1, She has nothing that deserves my jealousy. I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty. Don't you think so? 
-1," Yeah, right! But what did you put on your face last night, those little greenish things? "
1," They're cucumbers. They're natural skin soothers, natural healers of the skin. Haven't you heard them say on TV that, erh, they soften the skin, wipe out the roughness, counter irritation, and build strength and resilience?"
-1," Yeah, yeah, yeah! They wipe out tight, tired feelings and remove lines and age signs. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah! See I can even recite it. "
1," That's right! You've learned a lot, haven't you?"
0," Oh, what happened to your face, B? It looks like a heat rash."
-1, It's a razor burn. I cut myself when I shaved this morning. The burns and cuts are really irritating. 
-1," I know how you feel. Maybe you shouldn't have grown a long, long beard. "
1," Well, I thought it would be fun and would make me look more mature and sophisticated."
-1," Yeah, my Mature man! "
-1, Come on! Any advice? 
1, Maybe you could shave in the shower. The steam really helps soften your beard and moustache.
1," Hm, sounds like a good idea."
0, And you should avoid pressing too hard or tugging on your skin while shaving.
1, A good advice.
1, Hm. I would also suggest you try this cream I have. Use it on the affected area. It really helps moisturize your skin and lessen irritations.
-1, My toes feel very itchy. It's really irritating. I don't know what's happening. 
0," Let me take a look. Ah-huh, I think you have athlete's foot."
-1, What are you talking about? I'm not an athlete! 
-1," Come on, A, stop joking. You'd better take care of it before it gets worse. Imagine you have pus gushing out and rashes all over your legs. "
-1," Stop it, Dr. B. "
1," OK, OK. I guess I've got some cream for it. It really fixes skin in trouble. It's really a help for irritations and blemishes."
0, Is it this one?
0, Not really. That one is for heat burns.
0, Have you had athlete's foot before?
-1," Yeah. It was a very bad experience. You know, if you don't keep your feet dry and clean, the fungus will grow and spread out quickly. "
0," So my case isn't that bad, huh?"
1," You're lucky. Yeah, here it is. Now apply it to the affected areas. This cream is very effective in clearing out bacteria and stopping inflammation from developing."
0," B, you know what? NAME is going to get a face lift."
0, Oh?
-1," She even said she'd get the rest done, too! "
0, The rest?
0," Yeah! B, if my breasts were saggy, would you still love me?"
0, What?
-1," Answer my question, please! "
-1," What a silly question! Love has nothing to do with breasts being large or small, or being firm or saggy. "
-1, I'm just asking. You don't have to be impatient. 
-1, And NAME. She's crazy! No one can sustain youth forever. 
-1," Yeah. That's what I told her. Oh, I think I'm getting old. The forehead is wrinkled, the eyes are puffy, the sacks under the eyes are dark, and the skin is no longer as resilient as it was. Why! Age has set in! Maybe I also need a lift. Maybe, I need a new life! Oh, I really miss the good old days. At that time, my skin really felt so baby smooth! "
0, A. what're you murmuring about? It's getting late. You should've been in bed minutes ago.
0, Do you know anyone who's had plastic surgery?
-1, You mean like a breast enlargement? I don't think that's really necessary. That's not the way a woman should stay attractive. 
0, Why not? Why can't we go back to the way things were?
-1," Because! I don't know! But, A, you wouldn't do that, would you? "
-1, Darned right I would! 
0, Maybe make-up would be enough?
-1," Come on, B. Be open-minded! Look at my eyes! They're puffy. And my eyebags, they're dark and loose and full of lines and circles. I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings. "
0, What would other people think?
0, I don't care what other people think. I'm ready for a lift.
0, Our deadline is Monday.
-1, We still have much more work to do. 
0, Let's divide the work this weekend.
1, Great idea. I'll take half of it home.
1, Ok. I'll take the other half home.
0, We can email each other what we finish and review it together.
1, That should make things go faster.
0, Do you think we'll finish by Monday?
0," I think if we divide the work, we will finish by Monday."
1, Ok. Let's get to work.
-1, I think the owner is going to file for bankruptcy. 
0, How do you know?
0, He's been talking to a bankruptcy lawyer.
0, What should we do?
0, We need to start looking for another job.
0, Maybe he's just getting some advice.
-1, I'm not taking any chances. 
0," B, do you have a lot of clients today?"
0," No, I'm pretty open all day."
0, Could you fill in for me today?
0, Sure. Is something wrong?
-1, I'm not feeling that well. 
0, You should go home.
0, Your first haircut client is NAME at 10 AM.
0, Get it.
1, I want to exchange this dress.
1, You can exchange it with anything of the same price.
0, Are there any sales today?
-1," We're having a big sale next weekend, but nothing today. "
0, What's going to be on sale?
1," Dresses, skirts, blouses, pantsuits. everything will be on sale."
1, That sounds great. I'll come back next weekend.
1, Okay. Don't forget to bring your credit card.
-1, I think the company is in trouble. 
0, What kind of trouble?
-1, Financial trouble. 
0, What makes you think that?
0, I overheard NAME talking about bankruptcy laws.
-1," Oh, no! We can't lose our jobs. I just bought a home. "
0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is NAME. I have a huge favor to ask.
0, What is it?
0, Are you free tonight? I need a babysitter to watch NAME.
-1, I'm so sorry. I'm not available. We have tickets to the play tonight. 
-1, We do too. Our regular babysitter is sick and the tickets are non-refundable. 
0, NAME is home from college this weekend. Would you like me to ask her if she is available?
1, That would be wonderful!
0, I'll ask her when she gets home. She went to the store. She should be back in a few minutes.
1," Thank you! We will pay her, of course. I know she is great with kids. I remember her playing with NAME before. He really liked her."
1," Yeah, she loves children. She is studying to become a teacher."
1, That's great! She will be a good teacher.
1," If NAME has homework, she can help him with it."
1, Great idea! But I'm not sure NAME will like this idea.
0, Hey NAME. Do you know any good mechanics around here?
0, Yeah. I use a really good one. What's wrong with your car?
-1, I'm not sure. I think there is a problem with my transmission. 
-1, Transmission problems can be very expensive. 
0," I know. I took it to an auto shop yesterday and it was so expensive. I'm looking for someone cheaper, but who can also do a good job."
1, You should go to my mechanic. You can trust him and his repair costs are pretty reasonable.
0, Is he close to us?
0, Yeah. His shop is just a few blocks away.
-1, That's good. I hope I don't have to replace the transmission. That will be really expensive. 
0, I know. I had to replace the transmission on my old car. The repair cost more than the price of the car.
-1," That's crazy! If my repair costs too much, I'm just going to buy a new car. "
0, Can you afford a new car?
0, No. I would have to buy a used car.
0, Let me get my mechanic's phone number. You can decide what you want to do after he takes a look at your car.
1, Thanks.
0, I can give you a ride home if you need to leave your car there.
-1," If it's only a few blocks away, I'll walk. If my car is too expensive to fix, I better get used to walking. "
0, How's your first day at work going?
1, Good. I'm getting to know a lot of people in the office.
0, Have you met NAME? He's our technical support guy.
0," Yes, I had to call him about my computer."
1," Make sure you're nice to him. If he doesn't like you, he won't help you right away."
1, Good to know!
0, Our office goes out to lunch together every Tuesday. You should join us.
1, Ok. NAME mentioned that too.
1," Good. Well, let me know if you have any questions or concerns."
1, Thanks!
0, Hi NAME. Why do you look so nervous?
0," Oh, hi NAME. NAME and I are going out to dinner without the kids."
1," That sounds fun! So, why do you look nervous?"
0, We hired a babysitter. This will be our first time leaving the kids with a babysitter.
0, Really? Who did you hire?
0," Our friend's daughter, NAME. She is 18 years old."
0, NAME? NAME's daughter?
0, Yes. Do you know her?
0, Yeah. She used to babysit my children a couple of years ago.
0, Did you like her as a babysitter?
1, Yes. She was a very responsible girl.
1, That's great to hear.
1, You can trust her. She babysits for a few people I know.
1," Yeah, I heard she has a lot of babysitting experience."
1, She loves children. She wants to go to medical school and become a pediatric doctor.
1, Wow! She must be a smart girl.
1, She is. She was a straight A student in high school and she has been accepted to many colleges.
1, That's awesome!
1, She's babysitting a lot to save money for college tuition.
1, Now I feel a lot better about hiring her as a babysitter.
1," Hey NAME, I'm so glad it's Friday."
-1," I agree, NAME. It was a stressful work week. "
0, Have any fun plans this weekend?
0," Yeah, I'm going fishing with my buddies."
1, Lucky!
0, Do you want to join us?
0, I can't. I'm helping my brother move. He recently bought a house.
-1, That's too bad. We're going to have beautiful weather too. 
1, I'm glad we're going to have good weather. I don't want to move boxes and furniture in the rain.
0, That's true. When are you going to be done?
0, I don't know. He has a lot of stuff. It could be all day.
0," Well, if you get done early, why don't you meet us at the lake?"
0, Are you going out on a boat?
-1," No, we're going to fish on the lake shore. None of us have a boat. "
0, My brother has a boat. I can ask him if we can borrow it sometime.
1, That would be awesome! Thanks!
0," Dad, what are we doing this weekend?"
1," I have a surprise for you, NAME."
0, What is it?
0, Here. Open it.
0, I think I know what it is?
0, Can you tell by the shape?
0, Yeah. Is it a fishing pole?
0," Well, open it up and find out."
1, It is! I love it. I've never gone fishing before.
1," Your grandfather and I used to go fishing when I was a child. Now, I can take you."
1, I can't wait!
0, You also need a life jacket.
0, Why?
0, You should always wear a life jacket if you're going in a boat.
1," Ok, dad."
0, Now let's go to the fishing store and buy some bait.
0, What's bait?
0, Things that will attract the fish to the hook.
0, Like worms?
1, Exactly!
1, This is going to be so much fun!
0, Hey NAME. You're home? Where's your car?
0, Oh hey NAME. It's in the auto shop.
0, Again? What's wrong with it this time?
-1, I'm not sure. It's making a lot of strange noises. 
-1, That's weird. It's not even an old car. 
-1, I know. I've only had it for three years. My mechanic doesn't know what the problem is. 
0, He doesn't know? What is he doing then?
-1, Trying all different things. I'm getting tired of waiting for him to fix it. 
0, You should take it to another mechanic.
-1," I should, but I already paid him. He just keeps saying he will fix it. "
-1, He doesn't sound very trustworthy. 
1, I know. I should've gone somewhere else. But he was so cheap. He was the cheapest I could find.
-1, Maybe too cheap isn't always better. 
-1, I'm learning that now. 
0, You should demand a refund.
-1," I wish I could, but it's a little complicated. "
1, I really like my work schedule.
0, Do you work flexible hours?
0, Yes. I can choose my own hours.
-1, I wish I could work flexible hours. 
0, Why don't you?
-1," I can't. I'm in Accounting, so I have to work regular business hours. "
-1, I can't get any work done. 
0, Why?
-1, I've been on the phone all day with angry customers and our Technical Support department. 
0, What's going on?
-1, Service is down. It's not working in many areas right now. 
0, Do you need help?
0, Yeah. Can you grab some of these calls?
0, Sure. Who should I speak with?
0, You pick.
0, I'll take Technical Support. You can have the angry customers.
-1, This dress doesn't fit correctly. 
1, No problem. Shop around until you find something you like.
0, What's on sale today?
1," If you can wait until next weekend, you can save some money."
0, Do you know what's going to be on sale?
1, You'll be happy to know that everything in the store will be on sale.
1, I won't miss that. I'll wait until next weekend.
1, Great! Bring lots of cash so you can buy lots of things.

-1, I do not think so. 
0, Do you follow the news?
-1, Not really. It's boring. 
0, How can you say it's boring?
-1, It's always the same stuff: violence and politics. 
0," I have to watch, read, or listen to the news every day."
-1," Then you can tell me what's going on since I don't watch, read or listen to the news! "
0," Hi, B. This is A NAME. We met at the company golf tournament last week."
0," Hi A. Yes, I remember you. How can I help you?"
0, I was wondering if you were still interested in looking at my resume.
0," Yes, of course I am. Please email it to me. Did I give you my business card?"
0," Yes, you did. I will send it to you today."
1, Great! I look forward to receiving it.

0, What do you feel like eating this morning?
0, I usually just have a bowl of cereal.
1, The most important meal of the day is breakfast.
-1," Yeah, but I don't usually have time to eat a big breakfast. "
1, You can always make an easy breakfast.

1, That's a good idea.
1, It's not time consuming at all.
0, It doesn't take much time to make?
0, Would you like me to make something?
1, some oatmeal and toast will be great.
0, What do you want to eat for breakfast?
0, All I usually have is some cereal for breakfast.
0, You know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day?
-1," I sometimes run late in the morning, and can't make breakfast. "
-1, That's not a good excuse. 
0, Tell me what you eat in the morning.
0," I just eat some oatmeal, toast, and orange juice."
1, That sounds like a great breakfast.

0," No, but I did put on a few pounds."
1, That sounds like a dream job.
-1," It was, until one day my manager caught me. "
0," No more free cheese for you, huh?"
-1, Yeah. So sad. 
0, What's for dinner tonight?
0, What are you planning on cooking?
-1, I'm not making anything.

0, I'm on a new diet.
0, What are you eating now?
0, I switched from pasta to potatoes.

1, Natural food has more vitamins.
1, And it's just as easy to prepare.
0, How do you prepare the potatoes?
0," I wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes."
1, That's pretty simple.

0, Let's go get something to drink.
1, That's a good idea.

0, What should I drink then?

1, That sounds good.

1, I would like some water.
1, That's what will keep you from being thirsty.
-1, My girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table. 
0, Why was that?
0, I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.
0, What's the matter with that?
1, Her mom is a great cook.
1," So, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything."
-1, It hurt her feelings. 
0, Oh.
-1," I apologized to her, but I could tell she was still upset. "
0, Maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
1, I'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.

1, I think green apples are a lot better.
0, I've brought this dress back to exchange it.
1," That's not a problem. Leave it with me, and find something that you like."
1, I was hoping you'd have something on sale today.
1, We have nothing on sale today. But we're having a big sale next weekend.
0, Is the sale going to include dresses?

-1, But the same thing day after day gets old.

-1, I am absolutely famished. 
-1, Yeah. I am too. 
0, Where did you want to go for lunch?
0, I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria.

1," It's very good, and it's fresh too."
0, I do my shopping at Vons.
1," I shopped there before too, but the food is better at Whole Foods."

0," No, I haven't. Is the food good there?"
1, They have the freshest foods there.

0, I know where that is at.
0, Is there anything else you need help finding?
0, Could you point me toward the dishwashing detergent?
0, That's over by the paper towels and toilet paper.
0, I need to find the cereal aisle.
0, The cereal is over by the breakfast foods.
0, Where is that at?
0, It's by the oatmeal and breakfast bars.
0, I think I can find that.
0, Did you need help finding anything else?
0," Actually, I do need to find the dishwashing detergent."
0, That would be over by the paper towels and toilet paper.
0, I thought it was over there.
0," Yeah, you'll find it there."
0, I was thinking about cooking dinner tonight.
0, What do you want to make?
0, I'm not exactly sure.
0, I wouldn't mind a beef bowl.
0, How do I make that?
0, All it has is rice and teriyaki beef.
1," That sounds easy, but how do I make it?"
0," First, you need to make some white rice."
0, Then what do I do?
0, Then you need to shred some beef and marinate it with teriyaki sauce.
0, Is there anything else I need to do?
0, Then you cook it up and eat it.
1, I really want to make something for dinner.
0, What are you going to cook?
0, I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make.
1, A teriyaki bowl sounds nice.
0, I don't know how to make that.
0, All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef.
0," That sounds fairly simple, but how do I cook it?"
1, The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice.
0, What's next?
0, Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it.
0, What's the next thing I need to do?
1, Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy.
-1, I just spoke with my mom. She and my dad are devastated. The fire is moving closer to their home. 
0, What can they do?
-1, The firefighters say there is nothing they can do at this point. They have to evacuate immediately. 
-1, That's horrible. 
-1," I know. I wish I could help them, but we live in another state. "
0, Where are they going to stay tonight?
0, They're going to stay with my sister until they find another place to live.
0," Why don't they stay with us, too? They can come here after things settle down."
1, That might be a good idea. Maybe being away from there will help them forget about all of this.
1," Well, they will never forget. But hopefully, they will be able to move on."
-1," NAME, I'm so sad. That was my childhood home. I have so many memories of that place. "
-1, I'm sorry. I know this must be very difficult for you and your parents. 
0, Thanks. My sister too. She and I grew up in that house. My parents lived there for forty years.
-1, I can't believe a wildfire can destroy everything so quickly. It's just terrible. 
-1, They're going to lose everything. The firefighters gave them only a few hours to pack. 
0, I want to buy some flowers for my wife's birthday.
1, Red roses are always a popular gift for birthdays.
0, What are the roses going for?
1, They're only $20 a dozen today.
1, That sounds nice and cheap.
1," Yes, you're saving money because they're on sale today."
0, Give me the roses.
1, Could I interest you in anything else?
1," No, but thanks anyway."
1, Your wife will be thrilled with the roses.
0, I forgot my wallet. Could I borrow some money?
-1, You always forget your wallet. 
-1, I have a bad memory. 
0, How much do you need?
0,$20.00 
0," Now, you owe me $40."
0, Did I borrow $20 before?
-1, Yes. You haven't paid me back yet. 
-1, I told you that I have a bad memory. 
-1, I hope you don't forget to pay me back. 
0," B, can I have another cookie?"
0, How many have you had?
0, Four.
0, Four? That's a lot of cookies.
1, They are so good.
1, I know. Your mother makes the best cookies.
0," Hey NAME, what are you doing on the fourth of July?"
0, Hi NAME. My family and I are going to the park to watch the fireworks.
0, The park?
0, We do that every year. It has become our annual family tradition.
1, That's a great tradition. Does it get crowded there?
0," Yes! It gets very crowded, so we leave early and just hang out at the park all day."

-1," Yes, but it is very limited. "
0, What time do you get there?
0, We usually go around 4 pm. The fireworks show starts around 6 pm.
0, Do you take your dog?

-1, That's terrible. Poor dog. 
0, I have two tickets to the concert tonight.
0, How did you get tickets? The concert is sold out.
0," My boss and her husband can't go, so she gave them to me."
1, That's great! Where are the seats?
1, Third row!
1, Wow! Those are awesome seats!
1, I know!
0, Do you have any free time?
0, Yeah. I just got done with a project. Do you need some help?
1," Yes, that would be great!"
0, What can I help you with?
0, I have a project due this Friday.
1, OK. Just tell me what to do.
0, How much free time do you have?
0, I have a couple of free days before my next assignment.
1," Thank you so much, B. I will tell your boss she has a great employee!"
1, No problem. I'm always happy to help my co-workers.
-1, Why are you so late? 
-1, There was big accident on the freeway. The police closed all the lanes. We had to take a detour. 
0, Was anyone hurt?
-1, I think so. I saw two ambulances and a fire truck driving by. 
-1, That's terrible. 
-1, I know. I hope no one was seriously injured. 
-1, That's scary. Do you know what caused the accident? 
-1, I don't know. I didn't see it happen. 
-1, You should've called me. We were supposed to meet NAME and NAME for dinner at 6 pm. 
-1," After seeing the accident, I didn't want to use my phone while driving. "
1, That was smart.
-1, We should just eat at home tonight. I think traffic is going to be bad. 
-1, Oh no! 
0, What's wrong?
-1, I just got a text from NAME. She said she and NAME were in an accident on the freeway! They're at the hospital. 
-1, Oh my goodness. Let's go to the hospital now. 
0, Let's go to the party.
-1, I don't feel like it. 
0, Why? It's Friday night.
0, I want to watch movies in my pajamas.
0, Come on. NAME is going to be there.
0, I'll go for an hour.
0, Hey NAME. Are you going to NAME's birthday party tonight?
0," Is that tonight, NAME?"
0, Yeah. Can you go?
-1," Yeah. I've been so busy with school exams, I completely forgot. "
0, The party is at 7 pm.
1, Ok. Thanks for reminding me. I have one more test at 5 pm.
0, Did you buy a gift?
0, I forgot that too. What should I get her? Do you have any suggestions?
1, She likes clothes and makeup.
0, What did you buy her?
0, I got her a red scarf.
-1, Oh! I don't have time to go shopping. 
0, Why don't you just get her a gift card? Then she can buy what she wants.
1," That's a good idea. When is your birthday, so I don't forget?"
0, It was yesterday.
-1, I'm sorry! I forgot yours too. I'm a bad friend. 
0," No, you're just a busy friend."
1, I'm really happy that you could come.
0, Yeah. It's been years since we did this together.
0, I know. It has been a long time.
1," Well, anyway, a drink to our friendship!"
1, Cheers!
0, I heard you're moving to New York.
0, Yes. I've got an offer in upstate New York.
1," Oh, that's great! But I'm going to miss you."
1," Me, too. Let's keep in touch."
0, Yeah. Don't forget to drop me a line when you settle down.
1, Trust me. I won't. I'll keep you posted.
0, You have my address?
0," Well, I have your e-mail address."
1, All right! I look forward to hearing from you soon. Good luck!
1, It's my wife's birthday. I need to buy some flowers for her.
1, Most women love red roses for their birthday.
0, How much will the roses be?
0, You can get a dozen for only $20.
1," Now, that's a price that I like."
1, You're in luck today because the roses are on sale.
1, I'll take the roses.
1, Very good. Perhaps you'd like something else to go with the roses?
1," No, the roses are good enough."
1," Women love roses, so your wife will be very happy."
0, I just received a letter from one of my old high school buddies.
1, That's nice!
0," Well, actually I haven't heard from him in ages."
0," To be frank with you, I've been out of touch with most of my old friends. Only one or two still keep me posted about what they are doing."
0, I know. It's really hard to maintain contact when people move around so much.
1, That's right. People just drift apart! But you're lucky to be back in touch with your buddy again.
0," So, how is your new roommate?"
-1, She really turns me off. 
0, What happened?
-1," She's always making loud noises at midnight and when I remind her, she always makes rude remarks. "
0, Why don't you have a heart to heart chat with her?
-1," I tried, but it didn't work. "
0, But how many times did you try?
-1, At least three times. I guess I'm going to complain to the manager. I hope she can be evicted. 
0, How are things going with you and your roommate?
-1," Not very well. We're supposed to share the groceries, but I end up feeding him three meals a day. My grocery bill is huge, you know. I really can't afford it any longer. "
-1, I know how you feel. I used to have a roommate like that. He never offered to reimburse me for anything. 
-1," I'm really fed up with his freeloading, but I just don't know how to tell him that he should come up with half the grocery bill, because sometimes he treats me to a meal in a restaurant. "
-1," Well, honesty is the best policy. Maybe you just want to have a heart-to-heart, friend-to-friend talk with him. If he refuses to mend his ways, then ask him to move out. You can't let him wear out his welcome. "
0, There's a full moon tonight. Isn't it beautiful?
0, You know what they say about full moons.
0, No. What do they say?
0, Weird things happen when there's a full moon.
-1, That's silly. That's an old tale. 
0, You don't believe it?
-1," No, absolutely not. "
0, Do you believe in werewolves?
0, What are werewolves?
0," Creatures that are half human, half wolf. They come out when there's a full moon."
-1, Now you are being ridiculous. I'm going to look for the brightest star. 
0, Why?
0," If you see the brightest star, you can make a wish and it will come true."
-1, Now you're being ridiculous. 
-1, I'm going to wish that we stop this conversation. 
0, What if you see a werewolf tonight.
-1, You've been watching too many horror movies. 
0," Mom, can we go furniture shopping?"
0, Sure. What do you need to buy?
0, Something for my new apartment.
0, How do you like your first apartment? Do you like living alone?
1," Yes, it's great. But my apartment is so empty. I need some furniture to make it feel cozy."
0, What do you need?
0, I already have a bed and a sofa that you and Dad gave me. I need to buy a dining table and chairs.
0, Where do you sit to eat?
1," Right now, I eat on the sofa. But I'd like to invite people over for dinner and be able to dine comfortably."
0, Can you afford to buy a new dining table and chairs?
0," I have some money saved, but not a lot."
0, Why don't we try a yard sale? I always see people selling their dining room furniture at yard sales.
1," That's a great idea! Maybe if the furniture looks really old, I can get a good deal. I can just paint them."
1, Right! We should go today.
1, Yes! I'm excited to see what I can find.
1, Maybe I'll find something too!
0, Are you having a garage sale?
0, Yeah. I need to get rid of some things.
0, What are you selling?
0," Some clothes, small appliances, and the rowing machine."
0, Why are you selling the rowing machine?
-1, It was a waste of money. 
0, Didn't you use it?
0, I only used it once.
0, Why didn't you return it to the store?
-1, The store wouldn't take it back. It was too late. 
0," Hey NAME, have you seen the price of gas lately?"
-1, Yeah NAME. It's really high. That's why I've been riding the bus to work. 
-1," I wish I could ride the bus, but I would have to take three buses to get to work. "
0, Three?
0, Yeah. It would take me twice as long to get to work.
-1, That's not good. I only have to take one bus and it takes me directly from my home to my office building. 
1, You're lucky!
0, I know. What about riding your bike to work?
-1," No, I'm not very good at cycling and it's too far. "
0, You can carpool with someone.
1, That's a good idea. Then we could share the cost of gas and ride in the carpool lane.
0, Do you work with anyone who lives near you?
0," Yeah, my boss."
0, Would you want to ride with your boss?
-1," No, not really. I think I'd rather pay more for gas. "
0," Can I borrow some money, B?"
-1, Again? You already borrowed money from me last week. 
-1, I'm sorry. I just need to pay some bills. 
-1, That's what you said last time. 
0, I promise to pay you back soon.
0, Ok. You need to find a job.
0, I am hungry.
0, I am hungry too.
0, What are you going to order?
0, I am going to have a hamburger and French fries.
0, I think I am going to order a turkey sandwich.
1, The food here is delicious.
1," Yes, I love the food here."
1, I'm interested in this sofa.
0, That's the last one we have.
0, This one has a small tear in it. Can you give me a discount?
0, I can give you 30% off the price.
1, I'll take it!
0, I want to find an old music box.
1, We have a great selection. What decade are you looking for?
0, Do you have anything made in the 1920s?
0, We have six.
0, Do any of them have dancing figures?
0," Actually, two of them have dancing figures."
1, That's fantastic. I think I like this one.
1, A good choice. I prefer that one myself.
0, Is there any warranty with this?
-1," Oh, no, I'm afraid not. These things are just too old to guarantee anything. "
1, I understand.
1," Even if they break down, they're still works of art."
0, I don't know what to get NAME for our anniversary.
0, What did you get him last year?
0, A bike.
0, What does he want this year?
0, A car.
-1, Wow! He has expensive taste. 
0, NAME wants a new phone.
0, What's wrong with her current phone?
-1, She says it's too old. All of her friends have smart phones now. 
0, Why does she want a smart phone?
0, She wants to do social media and check emails.
0, She can't do that with her flip phone?
0, I guess not.
-1, Don't you think she's too young for social media and smart phones? 
0, I think times are changing and she needs to keep up with her generation.
0, You're more understanding than I am.
0, I see that the interest rates are rising.
0," Yes, the rates have gone up."
0, What does that mean for my loan?
0, Your loan payments will be higher.
-1, I can't afford higher payments. 
-1, I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. 
-1, I will have to wait for the rates to go back down. 
1, That's probably a good idea.
0, Will you contact me when the rates are lower?
0," Yes, I will keep your loan application on file."
0, I'm thinking about getting a motorcycle.
-1, Are you crazy? Motorcycles are dangerous. 
1, I'll be careful.
-1, I really wish you would not get one. 
0, Why? What's the problem?
-1, I would be worried all the time. 
0, Fine. I won't get one. I'll find something else to do.
0, I'm thinking about getting a pet.
0, What kind of pet?
0, Maybe a dog or a cat.
0, That's a lot of responsibility.
-1, I know. But I'm lonely every day. 
1, They are great companions.
0, Hello. How can I help you?
-1, I bought a laptop last week and I'm not happy with it. 
0, What is wrong with it?
-1, It is very slow. 
1, We can definitely help you with that problem. Can you bring it to the store today?
0, Yes. Can I bring it after work around 6 PM?
1, Absolutely! I will try to find out what the problem is.
1, Thank you! This is great after sales service.
1, We think supporting our customers after the purchase is also very important.
1, I will definitely be back for your other products!
0, I would like to return this jacket.
0, Is there something wrong with it?
-1, It does not fit. 
0, Would you like to exchange it for another size?
-1, No. I would just like a refund please. 
0, Ok. The full amount will go back on your credit card.
0, When is your business trip?
0, Tomorrow.
0, Who are you meeting with tomorrow?
0," One of the managers, NAME. Have you met him?"
-1," Yes. He's a nice guy, but he's very disorganized. "
1, That's good to know. Any advice?
1, Be flexible because he changes his mind often.
-1, That can be annoying. 
1," Yes, it can. But have a good attitude about it."
0, Why?
0, Because he's the CEO's son.
0, Are you on the phone?
0," Yeah, but I'm on hold."
0, Do you have time for lunch?
0, Not right now. I'm trying to get a upgrade on my rental car.
0, Are you having any luck?
0, The rental car agent is talking to her supervisor right now.
0, How are you negotiating?
0, I told the agent that our company does a lot of business with this rental company.
0, You're right. We do.
0," A, hold on. The agent is back on the phone."
0, I need a place to stay in the country.
0, What kind of place?
0, I would like to stay in a small cottage.
0, What do you want to do there?
0," I want to take pictures of the flowers, trees, and meadows."
0, What are meadows?
0, A meadow is an open area of grass.
0, Why do you want to take pictures?
0, I got a camera for my birthday.
1," Happy Birthday, A."
0, Excuse me. I'm looking for an old music box.
0, Any particular decade?
1, Something made in the 20s would be nice.
0," We had seven, but we sold one this morning."
0, Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes?
1, You're in luck. Two of them have dancing figures.
1, These are great. I think I'll take this one.
1," Yes, that one is very nice."
0, Does this come with a warranty?
-1," I'm sorry, but you just have to take your chances. "
1, That doesn't surprise me.
1," Even if it doesn't work, it is a beautiful collectible."
0, I think I am finally going to get a cell phone.
0, You don't have a cell phone?
0," No. I didn't think it was necessary, but now I think I should get one."
0, What made you decide to get one now?
-1, My car broke down in the middle of the road last night and I had to walk to the nearest pay phone to call a friend. It was scary walking alone at night. 
1," Yeah, cell phones are very convenient. Do you know what kind you want to get?"
0, Just a basic one. I don't need anything fancy.
0, Do you want a smartphone?
0, What is that?
0, You don't know what a smartphone is?
0, No. Can you explain it to me?
0, A smartphone is a cell phone that also has computer features. You have e-mail and Internet access.
-1, I don't need those things. I don't even have an e-mail address. 
0, You don't have an e-mail address?
0, No.
0, Then how do you send written communication to other people?
0, I write and mail letters.
1, Wow! That's amazing! People don't mail letters anymore.
0," But I think I will get a cell phone, just in case of an emergency."
1," That's a good idea! Welcome to modern technology, NAME!"
0, What should we have for dinner?
0, Let's order something for delivery.
1, That's a great idea!
1, There are a lot of choices around our neighborhood.
0, What are the choices?
0," We can order pizza, Chinese food, Indian food, sandwiches, or something else."
0, What sounds good to you?
1, Anything is ok to me.
0, How about Chinese food? We can eat the leftovers tomorrow night.
1, Sounds great.
0, Hey NAME. Did you hear what happened to Winston?
0," No, NAME. What happened?"
-1, He got fired this morning. 
0, Why?
-1, He got caught stealing money from the company. 
0, How did he steal it?
0, I don't know.
0, Did the boss call the police?
0," No, not yet."
0, Why not?
0," He said that if he returns the money, they will not call the police."
0, What if he doesn't return the money.
0, Then he's going to call the police.
-1, He better return the money. 
-1, I know. He is so foolish. Why would he do this? 
-1, I always thought there was something strange about him. 
-1, He's going to have a hard time finding another job after this. 
-1, I agree. How can anyone trust him after this? 
0, Who are the beautiful flowers from?
0, They're from my boyfriend.
1, That's so sweet! Those are long-stemmed roses.
1, I know. They're beautiful.
0, How many are there?
0, I counted 30.
1, Wow! That must've been expensive.
1, I need to find a vase. I don't want them to die.
0, Is there one in the kitchen?
-1, I found one. But it's too small. 
1," Yeah, that bouquet is huge. You're a lucky woman. I wish my boyfriend would send me flowers."
1, Oh. Thanks.
0, Hello?
1, Hi NAME. This is NAME. I have great news!
0, What is it?
1, I got the job!
1, Congratulations! I knew you would get it.
1, Thanks! I'm so excited. I beat out 4 other applicants.
1, That's great! When is your first day of work?
0, Next Monday.
0, What are you going to do for the next few days?
1, I'm going to go shopping for some new suits. We have to dress nicely in the office.
0, Have you told anyone else yet?
1," No, I wanted to tell you first. You're my best friend."
1," Well, we should celebrate."
1, Ok! What should we do?
1, I'll buy you dinner.
0, You don't have to do that.
0, I know. But you can buy me dinner after you get your first paycheck.
1, That's a deal!
0, What did NAME say?
-1, I'm getting laid off. 
0, What happened?
-1, He said the company is restructuring and they don't need my position anymore. 
-1, Wow! I can't believe it! 
-1, I know. I just bought a house. 
-1, That is awful! What are you going to do? 
-1, They offered me a severance package. 
-1, Oh no! NAME wants to see me in his office. 
0," Good luck, A."
0," B, why are you standing in the rain?"
0, I'm waiting for the bus.
0, Do you need a ride?
1, That would be great! I think I missed the bus.
1, Get in the car. You're all wet.
1," Thanks, A. I'll buy you a cup of coffee."
0, Hi NAME. Do you know anyone who wants a dog?
0, What kind of dog? Yours?
0, Yeah. We have to give our dog away.
1, Why? You love NAME.
-1, I know. But we just discovered that our son is allergic to dogs. 
0, Really?
-1," Yeah, he sneezes and gets a rash every time he pets him. "
-1, That's terrible. 
-1," When NAME was a baby, we didn't know he was allergic. But now he's crawling around and playing with NAME. His symptoms get really bad. "
-1, I'm so sorry to hear that. You and NAME have had NAME since he was a puppy. I remember when all three of you moved in next door. 
-1, I know. We got NAME before our son was born. NAME is so sad. 
0, How about your relatives? Are there any family members that could take NAME? Then you can still see him whenever you want.
-1, I asked my sister and NAME asked his brothers. But no one is able to take a dog right now. 
-1," Well, our kids are all grown up and living on their own. NAME and I get lonely sometimes. Would you like us to adopt NAME? "
0, Really? You would do that?
1, NAME and I really like NAME. He's housetrained and well-behaved. He rarely barks too.
1, Don't you need to talk to NAME first!
1," Oh, he'll say yes. He's been talking about getting a dog lately. He'll be happy it's NAME."
1, Thank you so much!
1, You can come see him anytime.
1, You're the best neighbor anyone could have.
-1, I can't stand talking to NAME. 
-1, I know. It can be hard. 
-1, He is so negative. 
-1, I stopped talking to him. 
-1, He has such a poor attitude. He is against everything. 
-1, He can be very annoying. 
0," NAME, are you all packed?"
-1," No, Dad. I can't find my fishing pole. "
0, Where did you see it last?
0, In the garage. I'll look again.
0, Ok. I'm almost done packing too. I just need to load the tents into the car.
0, I found my fishing pole. It was behind the skis.
1, Good. What is your mom doing?
0, She is packing food and snacks into the ice chest.
0," Hopefully, we will catch some fish to eat too."
0," Yeah. Dad, where is your fishing pole?"
1, I forgot it. Thanks for reminding me.
0, Are we going to the same campsite?
1, No. I want to try a new place.
1, Cool. Can I bring my camera?
0, Of course. But be careful not to lose it.
1, I'll be careful. I want to take a lot of pictures.
0, Make sure to take pictures of our fish.
1, I hope we catch big ones. I love camping and fishing.
1, I love spending time as a family.
0, Pardon me. I need an old music box.
0, Exactly how old a box do you want?
0," Actually, I was thinking about something from the 1920s."
0, We still have six left.
0, Do any of the boxes have dancing figures?
1, Dancing figures are quite popular. Two of the boxes have them.
1, I love the dancing figures. I'll take this music box.
1," Yes, I think you'll be very satisfied with that one."
0," I was wondering, does this come with any kind of warranty?"
1," No. But if something goes wrong with it, I know someone who repairs these things."
1, I was just hoping.
1, It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do.
0, A few of us are going out for drinks tonight. Do you want to join us?
0, Sure. What time?
0, We're leaving at 5 PM.
0, Ok. I need to call my wife and tell her I will be home late.
0, I should do that too.
0, Are you celebrating something?
1, Yes! We finally finished a big project.
1, That's great news!
0, Let me know if you can join us later.
1, Ok. I will text you after I speak with my wife.
-1, My company is filing for bankruptcy. 
0, Why?
-1, The owner says he's not making enough money to pay all the bills. 
-1, That's too bad. This company has been around for 30 years. 
-1, I know. It just can't compete with new technology. 
0, How long have you worked there?
0, Fifteen years.
0, That's a long time.
-1, I know. I'm going to miss that place. 
0, What are you going to do now?
0, Look for another job.
0, Do you want to join us for drinks after work?
0," No, I can't."
0, It's Friday night.
0, I already have plans.
1, We just got done with a big project. You should have some fun.
0, I know. Maybe next weekend.
-1, Ok. You're going to miss a great time. 
1, I'm going to have a great time tonight too.
0, What are you doing?
0, I'm having dinner with our boss.
0, Hi NAME. Have you been to the new amusement park yet?
0, No. When did it open?
0, Last weekend.
0, Was it crowded?
-1, It was very crowded. Parking is terrible too. 
0, Did you have fun?
1, Oh yes! The roller coasters are really fun. My kids had a great time. It was even fun for the adults too.
1, I didn't know it was open yet. I will have to take my son soon.
1, You should. They will love it.
0, Are the tickets expensive?
1," Yeah, they're pretty expensive. But your family will enjoy it."
0, Maybe we'll go this weekend. We don't have any plans on Saturday. My son has been asking about it.
0," If you go on Saturday, try to go early. There aren't enough parking spots. They need to add more."
1, Ok. That's good to know. Do you have any other tips?
1," The lines for the rides are very long, so be patient."
0, Ok. I assumed that. Now I have to convince my husband to go.
0, He doesn't like amusement parks?
0," No. I have motion sickness, so I can't ride any of the roller coasters. That means my husband has to ride all of them with our son."
0, Tell him to be prepared. There are a lot of roller coasters.
0, I'm going to an art gallery tonight.
1, That's cool.
0," My friend, NAME, is an artist. She's displaying her work there."
1, I love art. I paint in my spare time.
0, Really? I didn't know that. My friend is a sculptor.
1, Sculpting? That's fascinating.
0, Would you like to come with me tonight?
-1, I can't. I already have plans. 
0, She is going to be displaying her work all week. Would you like to go tomorrow night?
1, Sure. I would love to.
1, I can introduce you to her. She always loves talking to people about art.
1, I don't know that much about it. I just really enjoy looking at it.
0, I don't know a lot about art either. I'm just going to support her tonight.
1, You're a good friend. What is your interest?
1, I prefer music.
1, I love music too. But painting is my passion.
1, I would like to see your work one day.
1, I can show you some right now. I have them on my wall.
1, Let's go see them.
0, I have a meeting with the boss today.
0, What's the meeting about?
0, I'm going to ask for a raise.
0, We just got raises last month.
0, I'm going to negotiate for a bigger raise.
1, Good luck!
0, NAME. Are you going to watch television all day?
0, No. Is there something you want to do?
1, It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining. We should do something outdoors.
0, Ok. What should we do?
0, Let's go to the beach.
0, OK. I'll grab the beach chairs and towels.
1, Great! I'll pack some snacks and drinks. Don't forget the sunscreen.
0, Where is it?
0, It's in the bathroom cabinet.
0, Is there anything else we need to bring?
1, I'll bring the camera. I want to take pictures of the sunset.
1, Good idea! The sunset is beautiful at the beach.
0, Do you remember the last time we went to the beach?
0, No. It's been a long time. Why don't we go more often?
0, Because you're always watching TV.
1, Ok. Let's go to the beach when the weather is nice and watch TV when it rains.
1, That's a deal!
0," Dad, what are we doing today?"
1," NAME, it's a surprise."
0, Is it a special occasion?
0, No. Just a short family trip.
0, Does Mom know?
0, Of course. It was her idea.
0, Where is Mom?
0, She is at the store getting things for our trip.
1, I'm so curious. Can you please tell me?
0, No. You have to be patient.
0, Ok. Can I help you with anything?
0, Sure. Why don't you pack your swimsuit and life jacket?
1, I know what we're doing!
0, You do?
1, Yes. We're going to the lake!
0, How did you know?
0," You asked me to pack a swimsuit and a life jacket. Also, you are pulling out the canoe from the garage."
0, It looks like I can't keep a secret.
0," Hey NAME, are you done with your final exams?"
0," Yes, NAME! I had my last one this morning. How about you?"
0," Yeah, I got done an hour ago."
0, Do you want to celebrate?
1, Sure! What should we do?
0, I don't know. Should we throw a party?
0, What if our friends are not done with exams.
0," Yeah, you're right. Do you want to go dancing?"
-1, I don't know how to dance. 
1, You don't? It's easy. Just move your body to music.
-1, I look silly when I dance. 
1, Me too. I don't care.
0, Let's do something else.
0, Ok. Do you have any ideas?
0, Do you want to go see a play?
-1, That sounds boring. I want to do something active. 
0, I think we have different ideas of fun.
0, Yeah. How about shopping? Do you want to go to the mall?
1, I love shopping. Let's do that. We can eat dinner there too.
1, Great! Let's meet at the department store at 4 pm.
0, Hi NAME. Why are you all dressed up?
0, Oh hi NAME. NAME and I are going to a play tonight. My daughter is the lead actress.
1, Oh really? How exciting.
1, This will be her first performance. She is a drama student in college and she got the lead role.
1, I'd love to see her perform some day. Let me know when she will be on stage again.
1, Ok. I will. I'm so excited and proud of her.
0, Is she nervous?
1," Yes, she is very nervous. But she loves acting, so this will be a true test for her."
0, Is this part of her school assignment?
0, No. This is something she auditioned for on her own.
0, She won the lead part?
1, Yeah. She was shocked. Her drama professor is coming too.
0, How does she feel about that?
0, She's more nervous about her drama professor than the rest of the audience.
0, But she is not going to be graded on it.
1," Yeah, but she wants to do well in front of him."
1," I understand. Well, have a lovely time tonight!"
0, I want to purchase an old music box.
1, We have a good variety. What decade would you like?
1, I was hoping I could find something made in the 20s.
0, There are six on this table.
1, I hope at least one of them has dancing figures.
1, Many people like the dancing figures. Two of our boxes have the figures.
1, It's so hard to choose. I think I'll take this one.
1, That one will bring you many hours of pleasure.
0, Does a warranty come with this music box?
-1," I'm sorry, but if it breaks down, you're on your own. "
0, I just thought I would ask.
0," When you buy a Model T, you can't expect a warranty."
1, Hey NAME. My family and I want to do something fun this weekend? Do you have any suggestions?
1, The weather is going to be nice. You should do something outdoors.
1," Yeah, it's supposed to be sunny all weekend."
0, How about a picnic at the park?
1, We do that often. I want to do something more fun.
0, How about the city zoo? I heard that bear cubs were recently born there.
1, That's a good idea. We haven't been to the zoo in a long time.
1, Then you should definitely go this weekend.
-1," The last time we were there, it started raining. None of the animals wanted to come out. "
-1, That must've been boring. 
-1, It was boring. The kids wanted to go home early. 
1, The animals should be more visible since the weather is going to be sunny this weekend.
1," Yeah. I think we will go to the zoo. Hopefully, this time it'll be more fun."
0," Actually, I have four tickets to the zoo. You can have them."
1," Thanks, NAME! Let me pay you for them. Zoo tickets are expensive."
1, Don't worry about it. It's my gift to you since your last visit was not fun.
1, Are you sure! This is very generous of you.
1," Also, you mowed my lawn a few times after I had back surgery last year. I really appreciated that."
1, I'm glad we're neighbors.
0, Our client has invited us to play at his private golf course.
1, That should be fun.
0, Can you join us this Saturday?
-1, No. I'm busy this weekend. 
-1, I heard that our client does not like to lose. I am a little worried. 
-1, Then maybe I should join you. I'm terrible at golf. 
0, Did you hear about NAME and NAME?
0," No, what's going on?"
-1, They're getting a divorce. 
0, Really? They've been married for 30 years.
-1, NAME cheated on NAME. 
-1, That is awful! 
1," Why do you look so happy, NAME?"
1, I was just on the phone with my daughter. She is having a baby.
1, How exciting!
1, This will be our first grandchild.
0, Is the baby a boy or a girl?
0, She doesn't know yet. She is only three months pregnant.
0," Three months? So, the baby is due in June?"
1," Yes. I'm going to be a grandmother in June! How many grandchildren do you have, NAME?"
0, I have three. Two grandsons and one granddaughter.
0," Yes, I remember now. They visit you often."
1," Yes, they do. I love when they visit."
1, I'm so excited. I'm going to go shopping to buy my grandchild some clothes.
0," Hey NAME, should we do something special for Grandma and Grandpa's anniversary?"
0, Sure. How long have they been married?
0, 50 years.
1, 50 years! That's a really long time.
0, I know. They got married in their early twenties.
1, That's amazing! We should definitely do something special.
1, Why don't we throw them a surprise party? We can invite all of our relatives.
1, That's a great idea.
0, Let's make a slideshow of their life together.
1, Perfect! That's going to be so beautiful.
0, I'm sure Mom has a lot of pictures we can go through.
1, Let's meet at Mom's tonight and plan the whole party.
0," Yeah, we'll need her help."
0," We can show pictures of their wedding, their children, and grandchildren."
-1, Too bad we aren't doing this next year. 
0, Why?
0, Then we would have a picture of their great grandchild.
0, What? You're pregnant?
1, Yeah!
1, There's going to be another big celebration next year!
0, I want my son to go to an Ivy League college.
1, You have high expectations.
1, Of course I do. He's smart.
-1, That's a lot of pressure for him. 
1, He can handle it.
0, I hope he meets your expectations.
0, Hi NAME. How did you like the hotel?
1," It was lovely, NAME. The rooms were spacious and clean."
0, Did you get a good deal on it?
1," Yeah. They had an online special. If you reserved a room three weeks early, you got 20% off the regular room rate."
1, That's a good deal.
1, The swimming pool and spa were really nice too. The swimming pool was warm. There was also a sauna.
1," Oh, that's very nice. NAME loves saunas. I need to tell him about this place."
1, The parking is free and so is the Wi-Fi.
1, That's good to know.
1, Hi NAME. Your garden is looking beautiful.
1," Thank, NAME. I've been working hard on it."
1, It looks like you have.
1, I water my flowers regularly and I use a good fertilizer.
-1," My garden looks terrible. No matter how hard I try, everything dies. "
0, Are you using a good fertilizer?
0, I think so. I also water my flowers regularly and trim any dead leaves.
1, You're doing all of the right things.
-1, I don't know what's wrong. 
0, Maybe you don't have a green thumb.
0, What is a green thumb?
0, A green thumb means you have good gardening skills.
-1, Oh. Then I definitely do not have a green thumb. 
0, Hi NAME. Do you want to grill some streaks tonight?
1, Hi NAME. Steaks sound delicious.
0, They are on sale at the market.
0, Should we invite some friends?
1, Ok. Who?
0, How about NAME and NAME.
0, Ok. But NAME is a vegetarian.
0, What is a vegetarian?
0, A vegetarian is a person who does not eat meat.
0, Oh. Maybe we should invite someone else.
0, How about NAME?
1, Ok. Let's invite NAME and NAME.
1, Hi NAME. I have some new tomatoes and cucumbers from my garden. Would you like some?
1," I would love some, NAME. The tomatoes you gave me last time were delicious."
0, I know. I made spaghetti sauce with them. I'm growing more vegetables this year.
0, What are you growing?
0, Zucchinis and lettuce.
1, That's amazing! You won't have to buy any more vegetables at the market.
0, I know. I'll let you know when the zucchinis and lettuce are ready.
1, Thank you. You're so generous.
1," Well, you always make me apple pies with apples from your apple tree."
1, I will make you more in exchange for the vegetables.
1, That's a deal!
0, Have you thought about selling your vegetables at the local farmer's market?
1, No. I like giving them to my family and friends.
1, That's nice of you.
1, Your too.
0, I'm searching for an old music box.
1, You came to the right place. Any particular decade?
1," If you had a box made in the 20s, that would be nice."
0," We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six."
0, Would any of them have dancing figures?
1," Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures."
1," They're both so beautiful. Let me have this one, I think."
1," That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it?"
0, One last question: Do you provide a warranty with the box?
-1," Oh, no. Everything we sell here is 'as is' . "
1," Okay, I will buy this."
1," Trust me, you will not regret it."
-1, Why is our boss so grumpy? 
0, What happened?
0, I asked him a simple question.
0, How did he answer you?
-1, He answered so rudely for no reason. 
0, What did you ask him?
0, I asked him how he was doing this morning.
-1, He's not a morning person. 
-1," He's not a morning, afternoon, or night person. "
0, I think you're right.
0, Hi NAME. What is NAME going to be for Halloween?
0, Hi NAME. She wants to be a ballerina. What about NAME?
0, She can't decide between a bear and a lion.
1, That's cute. Are you going to make her costume?
-1," No, not this year. It's too much work. How about you? "
1," I'm lucky. NAME took ballet lessons last month, so she can wear her ballet outfit."
1, That's smart.
-1, Yeah. Costumes can be so expensive. 
0, I know. That's why I made NAME's costume last year.
0, What was she last year? I can't remember.
0, A butterfly.
1, That's right. She was so cute.
1," Thanks. This year, she wants to be an animal."
1, That's not a bad idea. It's going to be cold outside. Her costume will keep her warm.
1, True!
0, I don't know what to get NAME for our anniversary.
0, What about jewelry?
-1, She doesn't like my taste in jewelry. 
0, How about clothes?
-1, She doesn't like my taste in clothes. 
0, Have you asked her what she wants?
1, No. I want it to be a surprise.
-1, How can you surprise her if she doesn't like your taste in anything? 
-1, That's why I need your help. 
-1, I can't help you. NAME doesn't like my taste either. 
0, We're 15 minutes early for the meeting.
0, Should we just wait for everyone to arrive?
0, Yeah. Let's find a seat.
0, Ok. So how do you like this weather?
-1, I don't like it at all. 
-1, Me too. It's been raining all week. 
0, It's been raining all week?
0, Yes. Have you been out of town?
0, Yes. I just got back from Hawaii last night.
-1, I bet you miss the weather there. 
-1, I do! 
0, Hello.
0, Hi Mom. This is NAME.
0, Hi NAME. Why are you calling so early in the morning? Is something wrong?
1," No, not at all. Actually, I have some good news."
0, What is it?
1, I'm having a baby!
1, That's great news! When did you find out?
0, Last night. It was too late to call you. I thought you might be sleeping.
1," You can call me anytime, NAME. How does NAME feel?"
1, He's so happy. He went out this morning to buy the baby a gift?
1, Already? That is funny! When is the baby due?
0, In June. I am 3 months pregnant.
0," Hey B, are you still here?"
-1, Yeah. I have to work overtime tonight. 
0, I thought you had dinner plans with your wife.
-1, I did. But my boss wants me to finish this report. 
0, Isn't it your anniversary today?
-1, Yes. My wife is not happy. 
0, You should tell your boss you have anniversary plans tonight.
-1, He won't care. Business is more important to him. 
-1, That's terrible. You should find another job. 
-1, That's what my wife said too. 
1, I can't wait for summer!
0, Why?
0, I'm going to Hawaii with my cousins.
1, That's great! I've never been to Hawaii.
1, It's beautiful there! The beaches are sandy and the weather is nice.
0," My family and I go to Germany every summer. My grandparents live there. They are too old to travel, so we have to go there every year."
1, That must be fun too.
1, It's a lot of fun. But I'd love to visit Hawaii someday. How long are you going to stay there?
0, Two weeks.
0, What are you going to do after you get back?
0, I need to find a part-time job.
0, You're going to work the rest of the summer?
0, Yeah. I need to make some money for college.
1, That's a good idea. I should do that too.
0, How long are you going to be in Germany?
0, Two months.
1, Wow! That's a long time. That's almost the whole summer vacation.
0," I know. My mom doesn't get to see her parents that often, so we stay for a while."
1, I understand. Family is important.
0, Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could do other fun things during the summer.
-1, I have a stomachache. 
0, Is it something you ate?
0, Maybe. I'm not sure.
0, What did you have for breakfast?
0," The usual, cereal with milk and a banana."
-1, Maybe the milk was bad. 
0, It didn't smell bad.
-1, Maybe the banana was bad. 
1," No, the banana was delicious."
0, Maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.
-1," No, that's not the problem. "
0, Maybe it will go away in a little while.
0, I would like to purchase some health insurance.
0, Have you ever purchased health insurance before?
0," I have health insurance now, but I want to look into other choices."
0, Do you know if you are interested in an HMO or a PPO?
0, Could you explain the difference to me?
0," To clarify it for you, with a PPO you pay more but you get to choose your own doctor."
0," When I pay for a service, is the payment the same for a PPO or HMO?"
0," The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO, but you can go anywhere you like."
0, How much will an HMO cost me per month?
0," Go to our website and fill in the questionnaire. Once we have all of your information, we can give you a quote."
0, I am calling to purchase health insurance.
0, Do you have health insurance now?
0," I was on my parents' policy, but I need to start buying my own."
0, You can purchase an HMO or a PPO. Do you know what you want?
-1, I don't know what I want. 
0," Let me explain it to you. An HMO is a little cheaper, but you can only choose certain doctors."
0," When I go to the doctor, do I pay the same out-of-pocket expenses for a PPO?"
0, The payments are a little lower for an HMO as long as you go to their doctors.
0, How much will a PPO cost me per month?
0," We need to factor in many things. Why don't you come in, and we will have you fill out a questionnaire."
0," I'd like to speak with the apartment manager, please."
0, This is he. What can I do for you?
1, I'm interested in the apartment on Main Street.
1, It's still available. Do you want to see it?
1," Yes, I would very much like to see it."
0, Does today at 6 p.m. sound okay to you?
1, I have no problem with 6 p.m.
1," Okay, I'll see you at 6 o'clock. Do you need any directions?"
1," No, thanks. I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like."
1, Should I bring anything with me?
1, No. I only need to check your driver's license.
0, I am looking for a pan.
1, No problem. What size would you like?
1, A big one would be nice.
0, How about this one? It's our biggest -- 16 in diameter.
-1," I like that one, but it's too heavy. "
1," Okay, try this one. It's made of aluminum."
0, This is much better. But it has an aluminum handle.
1," Here you go. NAME pan, but with a state-of-the-art, heat-resistant plastic handle."
1, That's perfect. I'll take it.
1, Great.
0, What's this stain?
0, I don't know.
0, It looks like blood.
-1, I think my nose was bleeding. 
0, You should wet your shirt immediately.
0, Why?
0, Because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
0, What's a little blood?
-1, Your white shirt is ruined. 
0," So, I'll just buy another one."
0, You can wear this one around the house.
0, Next time I'll soak it immediately.
0, What seems to be the problem?
-1," Oh, my God! It's my stomach. It's killing me! "
0, Where does it hurt the most?
-1, Right here! It hurts right here! 
0, How long has it felt like this?
-1," I felt OK when I woke up, and then, suddenly, I had this really sharp pain. "
0, Do you have a history of stomach pain?
0," No, and I haven't done anything out of the ordinary."
0, I think that we are going to have to get you to an emergency room right away.
1, Thank you for helping me.
0, Can you tell me where it hurts?
-1, I am so glad they called you. It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach! 
0, Does it hurt when I push here?
-1, It's mostly on my right side. Right here! 
0, Have you been feeling this way for awhile?
-1," I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner, but this morning the pain got really bad! "
0, Have you eaten anything unusual lately?
0," No, not that I remember."
0, We are going to take you to an emergency room right now.
1, I will feel better when I know what the problem is. Thank you.
0, Where are you feeling the pain?
-1, I can't stand up! My stomach is killing me! 
0, Can you put your hand where it hurts the most?
-1, It hurts smack in the middle of my gut! 
0, Did this just come on suddenly?
-1," I felt OK until an hour or so ago, and then I just doubled over. "
-1, My fingers hurt. 
0, Why do they hurt?
-1, I type too much. 
0, You should take a break.
0, I need to type to make money.
-1, But typing is causing you pain. 
0, Maybe I should see a doctor.
-1, Doctors are too expensive. 
0, He might tell me to rest for a while.
-1, He might want to cut you open. 
0, He might say I'm okay.
-1, He might say you have bone cancer. 
0, What did the doctor say?
-1, He thinks I have too much stress. 
0, Stress causes your stomachaches?
0, Stress causes different problems with different people.
0, So what did he tell you to do?
0, He said I need to think positive.
0, He didn't give you any medication?
-1, I hate medication. It makes me feel different. 
0, So how do you think positive?
1, I think about nice things.
0, Like what?
0," Like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand."
-1, You don't look so good. 
-1, I have a major stomachache 
0, Did you eat something strange?
0, I had spaghetti with clam sauce for lunch.
-1, Maybe you have food poisoning. 
0, Are you sure?
0, Are you under a lot of stress?
1, Not really. Things have been going OK.
0, Maybe you have a touch of the flu.
-1, I think that I might be getting the flu. 
0, Are you feeling OK?
-1, My stomach is bothering me. 
0, What have you been eating?
0, I had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch.
-1, Maybe the food had something wrong with it. 
-1," It could be bad food, but I didn't feel so well yesterday, either. "
0, Have you been under a lot of pressure lately?
0, I haven't been under any more stress than usual.
0, Perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around.
-1, I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu. 
0," Would you like to have some ice-cream? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from. I've got strawberry, peach, chocolate, chocolate chip, chocolate brownie, coffee, vanilla, rocky road, butter pecan, and praline."
-1," Wow! What choices you have! I wish I could, but I just can't. I'm on a diet to lose weight. "
1," Come on, it's just a bite. It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite."
-1, I'd better not. Please don't tempt me. Please! 
1, Gee! You are really strong willed.
1, You're darn right. I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong.
0," Well, I'd better not tempt you. Otherwise, if I give you a piece of cake, you might ask for a glass of milk."
-1, You looked tired. Didn't you get enough sleep last night? 
0," No, I had a bunch of my friends over, and we partied until the wee hours."
-1, No wonder you look so bad! 
-1," I guess I just can't take late nights like I used to. My head is spinning, and I have a migraine. "
0, I think you need to go home and take a rest.
-1," I wish I could, but I don't think I can keep my eyes open long enough to drive home. "
0," Don't worry! I'll give you a ride home. But next time, watch the partying, OK?"
0, I need a pan.
0, Okay. Do you have a particular size in mind?
1," The bigger the better, I think."
0, Look at this one. It's our biggest pan.
-1," That is big enough, but it's too heavy for me. "
0," Okay, we have the same thing in aluminum."
-1, This is nice and light. But it has an aluminum handle. 
1," Try this one. NAME aluminum pan, but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle."
1, This is very nice. I'll take this one.
1, That's a good choice. How do you want to pay for it?
0," Cash. Oh, I almost forgot. I need a lid, too."
1, I'm so sorry. A lid comes with the pan. Here it is.
-1, What's going on? You don't look so hot! 
-1, I have a stomachache. I think I got some bad food at lunch today. 
0, Really? But we ate at the same place. How come my stomach is fine?
-1," You have an iron stomach! My stomach, on the other hand, isn't as strong! "
0, So what should we do now?
-1, I've got to find a restroom and quick! I think I've got the royal runs. 
-1," B, you look bushed. Didn't you get a good night's sleep? "
-1, Nope. NAME kept me awake all last night. 
-1, Oh!? 
-1," I don't know why. NAME rarely snores, but last night he really started sawing some logs! And it wasn't just any snore. It was more like a herd of elephants running through the room! "
1, My grandpa used to do the same thing. Sometimes he would even wake himself up. He snored so loud! I always thought it was funny.
-1," Well, I'm certainly not laughing about NAME. I don't think I can take another night like that again. "
0, Have you considered buying some earplugs?
-1," You bet! In fact, I'm going to buy some at lunch! "
-1, I'm really concerned about NAME. His snoring is getting worse and worse. 
-1, Maybe he needs to go see a doctor. I heard that sometimes a bad snore can cause heart failure because not enough oxygen gets to the brain. 
-1, That's what I'm worried about. Sometimes it even seems like he stops breathing and I have to give him a push to make him start again. 
-1, I remember one of my friends' father had the same problem. The doctor said it was sleep apnea. Her dad had to get a pacemaker put in so that his heart wouldn't stop in the middle of the night. 
-1, You're kidding me! That serious? 
-1," Yes, that serious! "
-1, That's it! I'm making an appointment for NAME to see the doctor this afternoon. We can't let this go any longer. 
0, Why are you wearing your bathing suit around the house?
0," Yesterday I went swimming at your friend's house, and I forgot to put my suncreen on."
0, What happened.
-1," Well, the sun didn't feel hot when I got in, but I guess I was wrong. I got burned to a crisp! "
0, So why the suit?
-1, I can't stand to wear anything else. 
0," Hey, NAME. How's it going?"
-1, Not too great! I'm really stressed out. 
0, Oh?
-1," Yeah, I think school is giving me hives. See? "
-1," Oh, my gosh! Your arm is full of bumps! "
-1, And that's not the worst of it. You should see the bumps on my legs. 
0, What did the doctor say?
-1," He said to relax and take a break, but we both know I don't have any time for relaxing. "
-1," Yeah, but if you don't, it's only going to get worse. "
0," I know, I know. Maybe I can relax after this paper."
0, I sure hope so.
0," Hi, how are you feeling?"
-1," Horrible! I got a cold five days ago, and now it seems it's getting worse. The cough has gotten deeper, and I feel like I've been run over by a freight train. "
0," Well, let me take a listen to your chest. Deep breath in and exhale Inhale exhale."
0, Hear anything interesting down there?
0, It sounds like you have some congestion in your lungs. Have you been coughing stuff up?
-1," A little, but not too much! "
0," Well, we need to get that junk loosened up. Here is a prescription."
0, What's it for?
0," It'll help loosen your chest up and calm your cough. I want you to take it every 4 hours for a week, OK?"
1, Fine.
0, And don't forget to drink lots of fluids.
1, You got it. Thank you!
-1, I feel awful! 
-1," You don't look so good, either. What's wrong? "
-1," My head's stuffed up. I've got a runny nose, and I'm aching all over. "
-1, Poor guy! What are you taking? 
0, Nothing so far. Do you have anything I can take?
0," Let me go look. In the meantime, drink lots of orange juice...."
-1," OK, but hurry back! "
0, How did NAME like her first time at the beach?
1, She had a great time. She really enjoyed making sand castles.
0, When did you come home?
1, I guess we got home about 3:00. We spent a good 6 hours there.
0, That's a long time! Did NAME get burned?
1," No, unlike myself, I slathered her in sunscreen. She didn't even turn down."
-1, But you look like you got burned to a crisp. 
-1," You got that right! Next time, I guess I ought to remember to put sunscreen on, too! "
-1," B, you look pale. What happened? "
-1, I didn't sleep a wink last night. 
-1, Did you have something on your mind? You look so concerned! Maybe I can help you! 
-1," Well, I'm under a lot of pressure. My boss is very pushy. He assigned me three projects. Now the deadlines are near, and I still haven't finished all of my projects. "
0, Is there anything I can do to help you?
-1," Well, I guess one one can help me but myself! For the moment, I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress. "
-1," B, your eyes look swollen. What happened? "
-1, I broke up with NAME last night and I was all over the bed the whole night. 
0," Well, it's understandable, but NAME isn't the kind of guy that deserves your heartache."
-1," Well, I was restless because I was thinking how I was so stupid that I almost trusted the rest of my life to him. "
-1," Oh, B. "
0, I'd like to purchase a pan.
0, Is there any particular size that you want?
1, I cook a lot of big meals.
0, What do you think of this one? It's a 16 pan.
-1," That's the right size, but it's so heavy. "
1," Well, look at our aluminum pan. It's much lighter."
-1," Yes, this is very light, but the handle is also aluminum. "
1," No problem. Look at this one. NAME pan, but with a lightweight wooden handle."
1, Great. This is exactly what I was looking for. I'll buy it.
1, I think you'll love this pan.
-1," B, your eyes look swollen. What happened? "
-1, I broke up with NAME last night and I was all over the bed the whole night. 
0," Well, it's understandable, but NAME isn't the kind of guy that deserves your heartache."
-1," Well, I was restless because I was thinking how I was so stupid that I almost trusted the rest of my life to him.... "
-1," Oh, B.... "
0, Have you been working out?
1," Yeah, as a matter of fact, I've been going to the gym for half a year now!"
1, I can tell. You look really buff! And no more beer belly! Have you been lifting weights?
1," That and I do an hour of aerobics every other day! I tell you, it's addicting! I feel like a new man!"
1," Well, you look like a million bucks!"
1, Thanks.
-1," You look run down, B. "
-1," Yeah. I've been feeling under the weather recently. I caught a bad cold last week, and I still haven't gotten over it. "
1," Well, you wanna take sick leave? All you need now is a good, long rest!"
-1," I guess so! Even though I seem to be over the worst of it, I don't want to give the bug to anyone in the office. "
1, Good idea!
-1," I think I'm running a temperature. My head is spinning, my mouth feels like cotton, and I have a scratchy throat. "
-1," Let me see. Hmm, you'd better stay at home today. And don't work on the computer! Staying up late with that thing has obviously played havoc with your health. "
-1, I can't help it. I guess I'm addicted to the Internet. 
-1," If you want to keep yourself in good shape, you'd better quit surfing the Net deep into the night. I don't want you kicking the bucket! "
-1," Hi, B, what happened to your face? It looks swollen. "
-1, I had to go get a cavity filled today. 
0, Did it hurt?
-1, I don't even wanna talk about it. It killed me! 
0, How long were you in the chair?
-1, It took quite a while. But the worst part was getting numbed. They had to give me three shot! 
-1," Well, I guess you've learned a good lesson, huh! You have to take good care of your teeth! "
-1," No kidding! Not only can't I stand the pain, but man! Dentists are expensive! The bill is going to be humungus! "
0, Don't you have a dental insurance?
-1," I do, but it still doesn't cover everything. "
0, What happened to your eye?
0," Nothing really. I went to kiss my daughter on her tummy last night, and she reached up to stop me. When she did that, her fingernails scraped my eye."
-1, That sounds painful! 
-1," It wasn't too bad at first, but the next morning it really hurt. "
0, What did the doctor say?
-1," He said that it should be OK, but there might be a little scarring over my field of vision, so my eyesight may be blurry. "
-1, I'm sorry to hear that. 
-1, Who knew that a poke in the eye would cause so much damage? 
0, How are the kids?
1, They're doing well.
0, How old are they now?
0, NAME is 18. He's in college. NAME is 16. She's in high school.
1, Wow! They're growing up.
1, I know. They're growing up too fast.
0, Our company has lost a lot of money.
0, What happened?
0, We are going through the largest recall in the company's history.
0, What is the recall?
-1, Airbags. They can explode without warning. 
-1, That is extremely dangerous. 
-1, I know. We have already been sued multiple times. 
-1, I don't think the company can survive. 
-1, I know. We have a very bad reputation now. 
0, I think you should look for another job.
-1, I should have studied harder in college. 
0, It's not too late.
-1, I can't go back to school at this age. 
0, Why not? Lots of people go back to school.
-1, I don't remember anything. 
0, That's why you go back to school. You get to learn everything over again.
-1, I'm quitting my job today. 
0, Why? Can you afford to quit?
0, Did you see the news?
0," No, not yet."
0, The stock market is soaring.
0, What does it mean?
1, It means I made a lot of money!
0, What are you going to do now?
1," Retire early, pay off my home loan, and travel."
1, That's awesome.
0, Can you help me find a pan?
0," Are you looking for a small, medium, or large pan?"
1, I want a big pan.
0, Does this one look big enough?
-1," It's the right size, but it weighs too much. "
0," Well, what do you think of the aluminum pan?"
-1," It's light enough, but the handle will get too hot after cooking. "
1," Here's the same pan, but it has a space-age, heat-resistant plastic handle."
1, My family's going to love this one. I'll take it.
1, I'm so happy that you found what you wanted. Do you want to use a credit card?
0," Sure. Wait, wait. Does a lid come with this pan?"
1," Oh, I'm sorry. Here's the lid. Yes, it comes with the pan."
1, Your English is so good now.
0, I bought an ESL teaching CD and I visit ESL websites.
0, Are they helpful?
1, They are very helpful.
1, You learn very fast.
1, I practice every day. I want to become a US citizen.
1, You should have no problem passing the test.
0, I want to take the test next year.
1, I can help you if you need help.
1, That would be wonderful. You are a great friend.
0, Did you see what NAME is wearing today?
0, Yeah. It's not appropriate for work.
0, I know. She looks like she's trying to get attention.
0, Whose attention?
0, Her boss's attention.
0, He's married!
0," NAME, why did you leave dog poop on my lawn?"
0, I did not leave dog poop on your lawn.
0, I have proof you did it.
0, What kind of proof?
0, I secretly video recorded my yard.
-1, Oh my goodness. I am very sorry. 
0, There was an increase in the interest rates.
0, What does that mean for the bank?
0, People are not going to apply for loans right now.
-1, That's not good for us. We need customers. 
0, People will wait to see if the rates go down.
0, I guess we will all have to wait too.
0," Why are you so dressed up, NAME?"
0," Oh, hi NAME. I have a job interview today."
1, That's great. Where?
0, At the bank. I'm applying for a teller position.
0, But why do you look so nervous?
1," Because I don't have much work experience, but I'm a hard worker and good with numbers."
0, Tell them that.
0, I'm going to. I just hope I don't mess up.
1, Don't worry so much. You're smart and you get along well with everyone.
-1, Thanks. I'm just afraid that I won't be able to answer their questions. 
1, Just answer them the best you can. Be confident.
1, Ok. I just need to relax.
0, What time is your interview?
0, In an hour. I better leave soon. I don't want to be late.
0," Yeah, don't be late. That would be a bad first impression."
1, You're right. Thanks for your advice and encouragement. I feel much better.
1, Good. Now go!
0," Have you met NAME, my new roommate?"
0," No, I have not."
0, I'll introduce you when she gets home.
0, Ok. Is she nice?
1, She's really nice. She's our age too.
1, Cool! We should take her to the coffee shop later.
1, Great idea!
0, Hi. My name is NAME. I'm a new employee here.
0," What do you do here, NAME?"
0, I'm a sales executive. My boss is NAME.
0," I'm NAME NAME, the General Manager of the company."
1, I know. I was hoping to meet you.
0," Do you like Sales, NAME?"
1," Yes, sir. I am the best sales executive in my department."
0," Do you have a business card, NAME?"
0," Yes, I do."
0, Let's have a lunch meeting some time. We can discuss your future at this company.
0, I'm thinking about investing in stocks.
1, That's a great idea.
0, I need to plan for my future.
0, Do you know what you want to invest in?
0, I don't know anything about stocks.
0, You should talk to my stockbroker.
0," Hey, how's the job search going, NAME?"
-1," Not well, NAME. I've sent out over 30 resumes and no one has called me. "
0," I think a lot of people are looking for jobs right now. The economy isn't very good, so companies aren't hiring people."
0, That's what it seems like. But I need a job.
0, How long have you been out of work?
0, 3 months.
0, What kind of work do you do?
0, I'm an electrician.
0, Have you thought about opening your own business?
-1," Yeah, but that takes money. "
0," I understand. If I hear anyone looking for an electrician, I'll let you know."
1, Thanks. It's been frustrating.
0, Why did you leave your last job?
-1, I didn't get along with my boss. 
0, Maybe you should've stayed until you found another job.
-1, Yeah. That was my mistake. I thought it would be easy to find another job. I was wrong. 
1," Don't worry. You'll find one soon. Come on, let me buy you a cup of coffee."
1, Thanks.
0, I'm going to be out of town for a few days.
0, Where are you going?
0, On a business trip to New York. Can you keep an eye on my house?
0, Sure. There have been a lot of burglaries these days.
-1, I know. I'm a little nervous to leave. 
0, Do you have an alarm system?
0, No. Do you have one?
1, Yes. I feel safer with it.
0, Maybe I should get one too.
1, That's a good idea.
0, I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen.
0, What size pan were you thinking of?
0, I've already got a small pan. I need a big one.
1," Well, this one might work for you."
-1," No, that's way too heavy a pan for me. "
0," Here, lift this aluminum pan. It's the same size."
-1," Yes, it's very lightweight. But I don't want this aluminum handle. "
0, Here's a similar aluminum pan. But it has a heat-resistant handle.
1, This feels very nice. It's perfect. I'll take it.
1, I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later. How would you like to pay?
0," Cash. But first, I need a lid for this pan."
1," Oh, no problem. Here's the lid that comes with the pan."
0, Hey NAME. Do you want to come over after school?
-1," Hey NAME. No. I have to finish my chores. I didn't do them all week, so now I have to do them all today. "
0, What do you have to do?
0, Rake the yard and clean my room.
0, Is that going to take a long time?
0, Have you seen my room? It looks like a tornado went through it.
0, Why didn't you clean it before?
-1, I hate cleaning. Do you have chores? 
0," Yeah, but I try to finish them as soon as possible."
1," You're smart! Now, I have to spend Friday afternoon doing chores."
-1, That's too bad. I got a new video game I wanted to show you. 
0, Do you want to help me with my chores?
1, No way! I'm going to enjoy my Friday afternoon.
-1," Well, I have to get to work. "
0, Finish your chores earlier next time.
0, I know. I say that every week.
-1, My new neighbors are so noisy. 
0, What are you going to do?
0, I'm going to bring them a plate of cookies and ask them to turn the music down.
0, What are the cookies for?
1, I'm trying to be a nice neighbor.
0, Maybe that will work.
0," Mom, why do people get Labor Day off?"
0," Well, NAME. It's the day we honor working Americans."
0," So, we celebrate people that work?"
0," Yes. Back in the late 1800's, many Americans were working long hours under poor conditions. People protested to have better working conditions and a special holiday was created for workers. In 1894, Labor Day became a national holiday."
0," So, people have a day off from work?"
0, Yes. Many businesses close and companies let people take a day off. Post offices and banks are closed.
0," And, schools are closed, too?"
0, Yes. Schools are not open on this day either.
0, Is it always in September?
0, Yes. It's always the first Monday in September.
0, Do we do anything special on this day?
0," Well, now it's also celebrated as the end of summer."
0, Is that why we always have a picnic and get together with family and friends?
0, Yes. Some places even have fireworks and parades.
1, I'm glad there is a day to honor hard working people.
0," Yes, NAME. One day you will also be a hard-working American."
-1, I forgot to buy my mom a birthday gift. 
0, When is her birthday?
0, Her birthday is today. My family and I are going to take her out to dinner.
0, What time is dinner?
0, 6 PM.
0, You only have two hours to find her a birthday present.
0, I don't get off work until 5:30.
0, There's a gift shop in our lobby.
1, That's a great idea! I'll go there on my break.
0, Remember the gift shop closes at 5 PM.
0, Hi NAME. Where are you going with those books?
0, To the library. I found these under NAME's bed.
0, Under his bed?
0, Yeah. They are all overdue.
0, How did you find them?
0," We got a notice from the library that he had several overdue books, so I started searching his room."
0, How late are they?
0, About two months.
0, Didn't you receive notices before?
0, I found the notices in his room too.
0, Why didn't he return them?
0, He said he couldn't find them.
0, Is he in trouble?
-1, Of course he's in trouble. He doesn't get to play video games for each book that is late. 
0, That's five weeks.
-1," Yes. That's his punishment. He needs to learn not to hide letters that come in the mail. He also needs to learn to clean his room, so things don't get lost. "
0," NAME, your customer is asking for you."
0, Can you take my table's order?
0, No. You've been on the phone for 15 minutes.
0, It's an important call.
0, We have a lot of customers waiting right now.
0, It'll be just a few more minutes.
-1, You make too many personal calls during work. 
-1, That's none of your business. 
-1, Ok. I should let you know that your customer is the boss's daughter. 
0, I'll be right there.
0, I'm quitting.
0, Why?
1, I got a better job.
0, Where?
0, With our competitor. Don't tell anyone. It's a secret.
0, Our boss is not going to be happy.
0," Well, our boss didn't give me a raise when I asked for one."
0," NAME, can you cover for me?"
-1, Again? I can't keep covering for you. 
-1," I'm sorry, but I have to leave early today. "
0, What is your excuse this time?
0, I have tickets to the baseball game.
-1, You can't leave early for that. 
0, Our seats are right behind home plate.
-1, You really shouldn't go tonight. 
0, Why?
0, Because our boss has tickets for tonight's game. They are also behind home plate.
0, Have you read NAME and NAME by NAME?
1, Yes. It's my favorite book.
0, I've never read it.
1, You should read it. I have the book.
0, Could you lend it to me?
1, Of course. Let me know what you think about it.
0, Let's get a pet.
0, How about a cat?
0, I was thinking about a dog.
-1, Dogs are too much work. 
0, I'm allergic to cats.
-1," No, you're not. You just don't like cats. "
0, Can you tell me where the produce is?
0, It's in aisle A.
0, Do you know what produce is on sale?
0, I don't know. Check the flyer or check with the produce person.
0, Let's sell the house.
1, Why? I love this house.
-1, It's too much work to take care of. 
0, We raised four kids in this house.
0, They're all grown up now.
-1, There would be no memories in a new house. 
1, We would make new memories.
-1," I really don't want to move, NAME. "
0, Ok. I understand. You talked me out of it.
0, Working late again?
-1, Yeah. I feel like I live at the office. 
0, You should go home on time.
-1, It's not that easy. 
0, You need a better work-life balance.
-1, I know. I have no time for my personal life anymore. 
0, I'm trying to save money to buy a house.
0, When do you want to buy a house?
0, My long term goal is to save enough to buy one in 10 years.
0, I think you can do it.
0, I've always wanted my own home.
0, I think you have a very realistic goal.
0, Hi NAME. Have you seen any airline deals lately?
0," Hi NAME. No, I haven't. Are you planning a trip?"
0, Yeah. NAME and I want to visit our daughter in London. She moved there last year.
0, Why?
0, Her job was transferred there.
0, Does she like living there?
-1," She loves living in England. She wants us to visit, but the airfare is very expensive. "
0, Have you called any travel agencies? Sometimes they have special deals.
-1," I've called travel agencies and looked online, but everything is expensive. "
-1," Yeah, airfare is getting more and more expensive every year. "
0, I know. You travel a lot. Where do you buy your airplane tickets?
0, My traveling is for work. My company pays for the tickets.
1, That's nice.
0, Yeah. One of my business trips was to Hawaii. I got to fly in First Class.
-1, That's amazing! We rarely travel by plane. I'd rather take the train. 
0," Well, you can't take the train across the ocean."
0, I wish we could.
0, Guess what I heard about NAME.
0, Are you gossiping again?
0, No. I'm just sharing news.
-1, No. You're gossiping. 
0, Do you have a problem with it?
-1, Yes. I think it's rude to talk about other people. 
0, What's the big deal?
-1, Gossip can hurt people. 
0, I guess I never thought about that.
0, Try to put yourself in their shoes.
0," Hey NAME, you're home early today."
-1," Oh, hi NAME. I got laid off today. "
-1, I'm sorry to hear that. Why? 
-1, The company is downsizing and they eliminated my position. 
-1, That's terrible. How long did you work there? 
0, 15 years.
0, Wow! That's a long time.
-1," I know. I worked very hard, but I guess it wasn't enough. "
0, Don't say that. Companies usually downsize because they are losing money.
-1, I know. I just don't know what to do now. I have a family to take care of. 
0, Does your wife know?
-1, Not yet. She's at work. I didn't want to give her bad news there. 
0, I understand. What kind of work did you do?
0, I'm a graphic designer.
0, Really? My son is a website developer. Do you know anything about web design?
0, That's my specialty.
1, Let me give him a call. Maybe he can help you find a job.
1, That would be great! I really appreciate it.
1," Hi, NAME. You look great!"
1, Thanks. I lost 30 pounds.
1, Wow! How did you lose weight?
0, I don't eat any junk food and I work out every day.
0, I need to lose some weight too.
0, Do you want to go to the gym with me?
0, When are you going?
0, I go every morning at 5 AM.
0, That's too early for me.
1," Once you get started, you'll really enjoy it."
0, What's wrong NAME?
-1," Hi NAME. Our dog, NAME, is lost. Someone left the backyard gate open and he got out. "
1, Oh no. Let me help you find him.
-1, Thanks. My daughter is so upset right now. 
0, Have you called the local dog shelters?
0," Yeah, they haven't seen him. They said they would call me if they find our dog."
0, Does he have any identification on him?
0, Yeah. He's wearing his dog tag and he's also microchipped.
0, That's good. Should we make some flyers to post around the neighborhood?
0, My wife is doing that right now.
0, How old is NAME?
0, He's four years old and he's brown with white spots.
0, I know what he looks like.
-1," Oh, that's right. I'm not thinking straight. I'm just worried he was stolen or is injured somewhere. "
0, I understand. He's part of your family.
1," Yeah, he's a big part of our family. We got him when he was a little puppy."
1, Hey NAME! There he is!
1," NAME! Come here, boy!"
0, Is this all the luggage from this flight?
0, Yes.
-1, I can't find my luggage. 
0, It looks like your luggage is lost.
-1, I need my suitcase. I have a business meeting today and my suit is in it. 
-1," I'm very sorry. If we locate it, we will send it to you right away. "
-1," NAME, I am so angry! "
0," What happened, NAME?"
-1, Our hotel lost our reservations! 
0, How did that happen?
-1, I don't know. They didn't have a reasonable explanation. 
0," Well, can't you just make another reservation?"
-1, No. They said there are no more rooms available. 
-1, Oh no! That's terrible. 
0, We are attending my niece's wedding this weekend and everyone is staying at that hotel.
0, What about another hotel in that area.
-1, There's going to be a big doctor's conference this weekend. There are no rooms available at any of the nearby hotels. 
0, Did the hotel apologize?
0, Yes and they offered us a discount on our next visit.
0, Did you accept it?
-1, No. I was so mad. I told them that I would never stay at a place that lost our original reservations. 
0, What did they say?
-1, They just kept apologizing. 
0, What are you going to do?
-1, I don't know. My niece is very upset. Our daughter is the photographer. 
0, Where is the produce?
0," It's on the south wall of the store, in aisle A."
0, Is there any produce on sale?
0," I don't know. The produce person can tell you, though."
0, Hi NAME. You look tired today.
-1, I am tired. I didn't get any sleep last night. 
0, Why?
-1, Our neighbor's dog would not stop barking. He barked all night long. 
-1, That's awful! Did you complain to your neighbor? 
-1," I knocked on his door, but he didn't answer. I don't think he was home. "
0, What did you do all night?
-1," I couldn't sleep, so I tried to read a book. But the dog's barking kept distracting me. So, I just watched TV. "
-1, I would be so angry. You should've called the police. 
-1, I didn't want to bother the police with a barking dog. 
-1, I would have called them. What if there was an emergency at your neighbor's house and the dog was trying to alert someone. 
-1, That's true. I didn't think about that. But this dog usually barks because he's bored. 
-1, That's annoying. 
-1, I know! 
0, Hi NAME. What's wrong?
-1, I couldn't sleep until 3 o'clock in the morning. 
0, Why? What happened?
-1, Our neighbors' children threw a big party last night. The music was so loud. 
0, Wow! Where were their parents?
0, They are on vacation. They left the kids home.
0, How old are the kids?
0, They're teenagers. They're old enough to be home alone.
0, Did you complain to them?
-1, Yes! I went over there three times. I told them that their music was too loud and we were trying to sleep. 
0, What did they do?
-1, Nothing. They wouldn't turn the music down. 
-1, That is so rude! Why didn't you call the police? 
-1, I finally did. The police found some of the teens drinking alcohol. 
0, I bet that ended the party.
0, Yeah. Now my neighbors are heading back home from their vacation.
0, Do they know what happened?
-1, Yes. They are not happy. Those kids are in big trouble. 
0," Hey NAME, are you hungry?"
0," Oh, hi NAME. Yeah. Let's have lunch."
0, What do you want to eat?
0, How about pizza?
0, We always have pizza. Let's try something different.
0, Ok. Do you have any suggestions?
0, How about sushi?
-1, I don't like raw fish. 
0, All sushi isn't raw.
-1, I know. I just don't feel like having sushi today. 
0, Ok. Then what should we eat?
0, Maybe we should just order take-out. You get sushi and I'll get pizza.
1, That's a good idea. But I think I want Chinese food instead.
1, Chinese food sounds yummy.
1," Hey, we agree on something. Let's go out to a Chinese restaurant."
0, I'd rather eat at home.
-1, We never agree on anything. 
-1, I'm a little nervous about this business trip. 
0, Why?
-1, I'm meeting with the vice-president of the company. I heard he is a drinker. 
0, So what?
-1, I don't drink at all. I'm afraid he's going to think I'm boring. 
0, Then tell jokes. I heard he likes funny people.
0, I would like to make an appointment to see Dr. NAME.
0, What do you need to see the doctor for?
0, I just need an annual checkup.
0, Ok. The doctor's next available appointment is next Monday at 10 AM.
1, That's perfect. Do I need to bring anything with me?
0, Please bring your insurance card and photo ID.
0, Do you want to go to NAME's party?
-1," No, not really. "
0, Let's tell her we're sick.
0, Both of us are sick?
0, Yeah. We're roommates. She'll believe it.
-1," I feel bad about lying, but I really don't want to go to her party. "
1, The economy is stronger. I think this is a good time to look for another job.
0, Do you have places to send your resume?
0," No, I don't. Companies in our industry only hire people that have connections."
0, Do you have any connections?
0, No. How do I meet people in the industry?
0, You have to get involved and attend events.
0, Isn't there a charity golf tournament coming up?
0, Yes. It's a big tournament with many companies participating.
0, Do you have any advice?
0, Talk to a lot of people and don't forget to take your business cards.
1, Hello. Thank you for calling Dr. NAME's office. How can I help you?
0, This is NAME NAME. I'd like to make an appointment to see the dentist.
0, Will this be your first visit?
-1, Yes. I haven't been to the dentist in a while. I'm afraid of going to the dentist. 
1, Oh. You will like Dr. NAME. He is very gentle.
1, That's nice to hear.
0, Is there anything wrong with your teeth?
0, I have a toothache.
0, We have an opening tomorrow morning at 9 am.
-1, Do you have anything this afternoon. My tooth hurts very much. 
0," We are very busy this afternoon, but I can squeeze you in around 4 pm. Does that work for you?"
1, Yes! 4 pm is perfect.
0, Do you have dental insurance?
0," Yes, I do."
0, Ok. Please come 15 minutes early to fill out some forms.
1, Ok. I will be there at 3:45. Thank you so much.
1, You're welcome. We'll see you soon.
1, Bye.
0, Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
0, Sure. What time?
0, How about 6 PM?
1, That's perfect. I get off work at 5:30.
0, I can pick you up at your apartment.
0, There is a lot of construction going on in my neighborhood. Let's just meet at the restaurant.
0, Ok. What kind of food do you like?
1, I like all kinds of food.
1, There's a great Italian place downtown.
1, Sounds good. Let's go there.
0," NAME, I've been looking for you."
0, Is there a problem?
0, No. I need someone to pick up a client from the airport on Saturday.
0, I thought NAME was doing that.
0, He says he has to visit his parents this weekend.
0, He didn't mention that to me.
0, Are you busy this Saturday?
-1, I'm sorry. I just got an urgent email. I need to reply immediately. 
0, I see. I will talk to you later then.
-1, I'll be busy meeting clients all day. 
0, Where can I find the produce?
0, Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce.
0, What sales do they have today?
1, I'm sure something is on sale. Please check with the produce person.
0," Hey NAME, what are you doing with all that wood?"
0, Hi NAME. I'm going to make a coffee table for NAME.
1, That's nice! You know how to build things with wood?
0, Yeah. We just got back from furniture shopping and the price of furniture is expensive.
0," So, you're going to make a coffee table instead of buying one?"
-1, That's right. Furniture is too expensive these days. 
1, You're lucky you know how to build things.
1, My dad used to make furniture when he was younger. He taught me a lot.
0," Hey, could you make me something if I pay you?"
0, Sure. What is it?
0, NAME has been asking for a new desk. Can you build a desk?
0, Yeah. I built a desk for my daughter when she was in college. She still has it.
0, How much would you charge me?
0, It depends on what kind of desk you want. Show me a picture later.
1, Ok! I'll ask NAME to find a picture.
0, Maybe I should quit being an accountant and go into furniture making instead.
0, NAME should be here soon.
0, Ok. I'm not in a hurry.
0, Is this your first trip to Seattle?
0, Yes.
0, How do you like Seattle?
1, It's a lovely city.
0, Why does everyone look nervous?
-1, The stock market crashed. 
0, What does that mean?
-1, Our company lost a lot of money. 
0, What does that mean for us?
-1, I don't know if the company can survive this big loss. 
0," NAME, when is your baby due?"
0, Next month.
0, Are you going on maternity leave?
1, Of course!
0, How long will you be gone?
0, Three months.
0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is NAME. Have you finished the math assignment?
0," No, not yet. I'm still working on it."
0, It's really difficult. Are you having a hard time with it?
-1, I am. I've been stuck on a problem for an hour. 
0, Is it number 4?
-1, Yes! I cannot figure it out! Have you? 
0, No. That's why I'm calling.
0, Do you want to work on it together?
-1, I can't come over. I'm babysitting my younger brother. 
0, Do you want me to go there?
-1," No, my parents said I cannot have any friends over when I'm babysitting. "
0, I see. Do you want to discuss it over the phone?
0, Ok. What have you done so far?
-1, Nothing. I didn't know where to begin. 
-1," Me too. I wrote some things, and then I erased it. It didn't make any sense. "
0, What are we going to do?
0, Can you ask your parents?
0, No. They're not home either.
0, Let's call NAME. She's really good in math. She'll have the answer.
0, Hi NAME. How do you think you did on the math test today?
1, Hi NAME. I think I did well. It was pretty easy.
-1, Really? It was very hard for me. I'm having a hard time in this class. 
-1, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you should get a tutor. 
0, A tutor?
1," Yeah, I had a tutor last year and she helped me a lot."
1, That sounds like a great idea. Could I have your tutor's phone number?
-1," Unfortunately, she doesn't live in this state anymore. She moved away for college. "
-1, Ok. That's too bad. I don't know where to look. 
0, I can ask my mom. She knows a couple of local college students.
1, Thanks. That would be great.
1," Until then, I can try to help you too. I like math. It's my favorite subject."
1, Really? That would be awesome.
1, Do you want to work on our homework together?
1, Sure! I would love to.
1, Ok. Let's meet after school in front of the cafeteria.
0, I need to see Dr. NAME right away.
0, What is wrong?
-1, I think I broke my arm. 
0, Can you move it?
-1, No. It hurts if I try to move it. 
0, You need to go to the emergency room.
-1, The emergency room is too expensive. I do not have medical insurance. 
0, Do you have someone who can bring you here?
0," Yes, my friend is going to drive."
0, OK. Dr. NAME will take a look at your arm. Please come as soon as possible.
0, Hi. My name is NAME NAME. I am the office manager.

0, I had lunch with Sue today.
0, Your ex-girlfriend?
0, Yes. We bumped into each other at the store.
0, She's back in town?
0, Yeah. She moved back last month.
0, Are you going to see her again?
1," I'm single now, so I asked her on a date."
0, What did she say?
1, Yes! We have more catching up to do.
0," Ask Sue if she keeps in touch with NAME, my ex-girlfriend."
0, Hi. I'm NAME. I'm the new Customer Service Manager for this region.

0, I guess we will be working with each other.
0, Yes. Contact me if your customers have any technical issues.
1, Good to know. I'm looking forward to working with you.
1, Me too. Let's have a drink after work some time.
0, Which aisle has the produce?
0, Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce.
0, Are cherries on sale today?
1," I don't know, but I'm sure the produce person can tell you."
0, Hi. Are you new to the apartment building?
0, Yes. My name is NAME.
0," Nice to meet you, NAME. My name is NAME. I live on the third floor, apartment number 305."
0, I live on the fourth floor in 405.
1," Hey, you live right above me."
1, That's funny. I hope I'm not too noisy. I've been moving furniture around.
1, That's ok. It doesn't bother me. Have you met any of the other neighbors?
1, I met a few people. Everyone seems friendly here.
1," Yeah. Every month, we have a party on the rooftop. It's a potluck, so you can bring a dish to share."
1, That sounds fun! I love parties and potlucks.
1, Our next one is on Saturday at 5 pm. You should come. I'm bringing my famous pasta salad.
1, Sounds delicious. I'll make a chocolate cake.
1, I love chocolate cake. I can't wait to try it.
1, Thanks for letting me know about the party.
1, There should be an invitation in your mailbox. Everyone gets one.
1, I better check the mailbox then. I still have so much unpacking to do.
1, Do you need help moving any more furniture?
0, No. My brother helped me last night. I'm done with the big items. I just need to unpack pots and pans and dishes now.
1, Ok. Let me know if you need help. See you at the party.
0," Hi, my name is NAME. You must be NAME, our newest client."
0," Yes, I'm NAME. Nice to meet you, NAME."
0, Nice to meet you too. I'm the head of marketing.
1, I think we will be working closely together.
1," Yes, that's what I hear. Let me know if you have any questions."
1, I will! My first question is Where is the restroom?
1, I'm so glad there is no school on Monday.
1," Me too! But, why do we have that day off?"
0, You don't know?
0," No. Why, NAME?"
0, It's Memorial Day. This is the day we remember the people who died serving in the United States military.
0, Wow! I didn't know that.
1, It's an important day. It's not just a day off from school and work.
0, I see. Is it always in May?
0, Yeah. It's always observed on the last Monday in May.
1, I just thought it was another day off from school. I'm glad to know what this day means now.
0, It's really important in our family. My grandfather and great grandfather both served in the United States army. They both died serving this country.
0, Do you do anything special on this day?
0, Each year my family and I go to the cemetery and place flowers on their graves.
0, I've never been to a cemetery before. Is it scary?
0," No. We go every year, so it's not scary anymore."
0, Do all schools close on this day.
0, I think so. But only in the United States. It's an American holiday. Some businesses like post offices and banks close too.
1, Thanks for telling me what Memorial Day means. I'm going to go home and ask my brother if he knows.
0, I need a new job.
0, Why?
-1, This job doesn't pay enough. 
0, Are you having money problems?
-1, Yeah. I don't have enough money for bills and rent. 
1, But you drive a nice car and wear expensive things.
0, I need those things.
-1, I don't think you need expensive things. You just want them. 
0, What do you mean?
-1, I think you're spoiled. You need to set some priorities. 
0, Let's have another backyard barbeque this weekend.
1, Ok. That sounds fun. Should we invite some friends?
0," Yeah, let's invite a few couples."
1, OK. But we should buy some mosquito repellent this time.
1, That's a good idea!
0, Do you remember what happened last time?
0, Yeah. Everyone was bitten by mosquitoes.
-1, It was awful. We were itchy for days. 
0, We used so much anti-itch cream.
0, I think there are special candles that keep mosquitoes away. I saw a commercial for it a couple of days ago.
0, Let's get those.
0," Ok, I'll put it on the shopping list for the barbeque."
0, Do you think our friends will come back to our party?
0, We'll have to tell them we have mosquito repellent this time.
0," Mosquitoes are such pests. And, they carry diseases too."
0, I know. Now I feel like having an indoor party.
0, Don't let the mosquitoes win.
0," Mom, can you drop me off at NAME's house?"
0, What time do you want to go?
0, Around 3 PM.
0, What are you going to do there?
0, We have a science project due on Monday.
-1, How long are you going to be there? 
0, NAME asked if I could sleep over.
0, Did her mom say it was okay?
0, She is asking her mom right now.
0," If her mom says yes, you may sleep over."
0, Can you help me move furniture today?
-1, I'm sorry. I'm really busy today. 
0, What do you have to do?
0, I have to visit my parents.
0, I thought your parents were on vacation in Europe.
0, Oh yeah. What time do you need help?
0, Today is my last day in this department.
0, Where are you going?
0, I'm transferring to a new department.
0, Are you happy about that?
-1," Not really. I like being in Customer Service, but they need help in Accounting. "
0, Just try to do your best in your new position.
0, I need to change my desk location.
0, What's wrong?
-1, NAME has an annoying habit of singing while he's working. 
-1, That's weird. 
-1, I know. It's so distracting too. 
0, Have you talked to him?
-1," Yes, but he keeps doing it. "
-1, That's rude. 
-1, I don't think NAME hears himself. He always has earphones on. 
0, I think there's an empty desk on the other side of the office.
0, I want to own my own business one day.
0, What kind of business?
0, I'd like to run my own restaurant.
1, You're a great cook. Your restaurant would do well.
1, You need to have money and a good business mind too.
1, You're smart. You can do this.
1, I have to save a lot of money. It's my long term goal.
0, When do you want to achieve this goal?
0, Hopefully in 7 years. I'll be thirty years old then.
1, Let me know if you need an accountant. I'm great with numbers.
0," I'm looking for the produce section, please."
0, All of the produce is in aisle A.
0, Are bananas on sale today?
1," Here you go. Look in this flyer, or check with the produce person."
0," Mom, could you drop me off at the mall?"
0, Are you going alone?
0, No. I'm meeting NAME there.
0, Ok. How long do you want to stay there?
0, Just a couple of hours.
0, I'll pick you up at 4 o'clock. We're having dinner with your grandparents at 5.
0, I think I need a new computer.
0, Why?
-1, Mine is so slow now. It takes a long time to start up and it keeps freezing. 
-1, That's not good. How old is it? 
0, Several years old. It was a high school graduation gift from my parents.
0," Yeah, it's probably time to replace it."
0, I don't know what to buy. There are so many different models these days.
0, You should go to a computer store and ask about the different kinds?
1, That's a good idea. Do you want to go with me?
0, When? I have to work today. Can you wait until tomorrow?
0, Sure. I have to work until 5 pm tomorrow. Can you go around 6 o'clock tomorrow evening?
0, Yeah. Let's meet at your place at 6 pm.
1, Ok. I'll do some research on computers tonight.
1, My brother just bought a brand new computer too. I can ask him if he likes it.
1, That would be great!
1, See you tomorrow around 6 pm.
-1, Something is wrong with my refrigerator. 
0, What's wrong with it?
0, It's not staying cold.
0, That could be a big problem.
-1, I know. I'm worried that my food is going to spoil. I just went grocery shopping yesterday. 
0, I have room in my second refrigerator if you need to store some things.
0, You have two refrigerators?
0," Yeah. We needed two refrigerators because I cook a lot. There was a big sale at the appliance store, so we bought another one last week."
0, Is the sale still going on? I may need to buy a new one.
0, Today is the last day of the sale.
0, Then I better tell my husband. We need to go today.
1, Isn't your husband a great repairman. Maybe he can fix your refrigerator.
0, It's getting old. I'd rather buy a new one.
0," If your husband can fix your broken one, you can have two refrigerators like me."
0, I don't cook that much.
0, I have a meeting with the boss at noon.
0, Did she call a meeting with everyone?
0, No. I'm going to try to negotiate a raise.
-1, She's not easy to negotiate with. 
0, I've worked here for two years and haven't received a raise yet.
0, She's not good at giving raises.
0," Well, that needs to change. Do you have any tips for me?"
-1, Talk fast. She's very impatient. 
1, I know exactly what I'm going to say and I'm ready!
1, Ok! Good luck and let me know what happens.
0, How much is the delivery charge?
0, 5% of the total order amount.
0, That's expensive. We're buying a large amount of office supplies. Can you give us a discount on the delivery fee?
0, Let me talk to my manager.
0," If we are happy with the service, we will continue buying all of our supplies from your company."
-1, I am nervous about the presentation. 
0, Why?
-1, My English is not very good. 
0, Did you practice your presentation?
0, Yes. I've been practicing every day.
0, You can practice with me too.
-1, I'm really nervous about this conference call. 
0, Why?
0, The CTO is going to join us.
-1, I would be nervous too. 
-1, I hope I don't say anything stupid. 
1, You're smart. Don't worry.
-1," When I'm nervous, I say silly things. "
0, At least it's a phone call. She can't see you.
-1, It's a video conference call. She will be able to see me. 
1, Oh. Just look confident.
0," Can I tell you a secret, NAME?"
0," Sure. What is it, NAME? Is something wrong?"
-1, I'm afraid to graduate. 
-1, Why? That's silly. 
-1, College was easy for me. Now we have to go out and find a real job. 
1, That's the best part. We are finally adults.
0, Aren't you scared at all?
1, No. I'm excited to work and plan my future.
-1, I feel so immature. 
1," Well, you are acting a little immature. It's time to grow up, NAME."
0, I know. Studying and taking tests were easy. Now we have to work for the rest of our lives.
1, You sound lazy. You're a really smart guy. You're going to have a great life.
1, Thanks for your encouragement. I feel better.
1," You are being silly. If you are so scared of leaving school, why don't you go to graduate school?"
1, That's a great idea!
1, It actually is. You'll get a better job with a graduate degree.
0, I went to a networking event yesterday.
0, Did you meet a lot of people?
0, Yes. There were recruiters from many companies.
0, Were they helpful?
1, Yes. They were generous with their time. They gave us all really good advice.
1, That's great to hear.
0, Hi NAME. There's a new appliance store opening downtown today. Have you seen the flyer for the grand opening?
0," Hi NAME. Yeah, I was thinking about checking it out."
0, Do you want to go together?
1," Sure. I don't need a new appliance, but I would love to update my washer and dryer one day."
1, I just bought a new washer and dryer set. I love it!
-1, I'm jealous. My set is really old. It takes a long time to wash and dry. 
0, You should really look into upgrading your set. It can save you money?
0, How can it save me money?
1, The new washers use less water and the dryers uses less energy.
0, Really? Maybe it's time for an upgrade.
0, I can show you what I bought.
1, That would great! Maybe it will be on sale.
0, I wish I knew about the new store when I bought my set. I paid full price for mine.
0, You didn't buy it on sale?
0, No.
0, I'm not jealous anymore.
0, Let's go check out the new store.
0," May I speak to the apartment building manager, please?"
0, I'm the manager. How can I help you?
1, I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available.
1," Why, yes, it is. Would you like to get a look inside the apartment?"
1," Yes, it would be nice to see the apartment."
0, How about today at 6 o'clock?
1," Yes, I can be there at 6."
1, Sounds good. I'll see you at 6. Do you want directions?
1," I'm okay, thank you. I already checked out the address on MapQuest."
1, Is there anything that I need to bring with me?
1, No. I won't need to see anything except your driver's license.
0, I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale.
0," Well, we just got in some mangoes."
0, Mangoes. What are they?
0," Well, it's a fruit with a big nut in it."
0, Can you eat the nut?
0," No, you peel off the skin and throw out the nut."
0, How much are they?
0," Well, the sale price is $1 each."
0, What does a mango taste like?
0, They're like a citrus fruit.
0, How do I know if it's ripe?
1, You can buy them hard. Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel.
0, Where do they come from?
0, Most of them in this store are from Mexico.
0, Have you met the company's new CEO?
0, No. Have you?
1, Yes. She's very nice.
-1, Really? I heard she was very mean. 
0, She asked us a lot of questions about employee happiness and concerns.
-1," I heard if she doesn't like what you say, she will fire you. "
-1, NAME is stressed out. 
0, Why?
0, The new CTO is visiting our office.
0, So what's the big deal?
0, It is a big deal to NAME. She's one of the managers.
1, NAME is a great boss.
1, She wants to make a good first impression.
0, She hasn't met the new CTO yet?
0, No. This will be her first time meeting him.
0, No wonder NAME is nervous.
0," NAME, how was school today?"
1," Mom, it was fun. I made a new friend."
1, That's nice. What's her name?
0, Her name is NAME.
0, Is she new to your school?
0," Yeah, she's a new student. She moved here from Seattle, Washington."
0, You have an aunt who lives in Seattle.
1," I know. I like Seattle. It's beautiful there, but it rains too much."
1, Yeah. That's why we're staying in sunny California.
1," NAME and I have a lot in common. We both like drawing, playing with dogs, and eating pizza."
0, You should invite her over for dinner one night.
0," Can we, Mom?"
1, Sure. We can order pizza.
0, Maybe I'll ask her if she can come over on Friday.
1, Ok. Let's invite her parents too. We can get to know them.
1," That's a good idea. They don't have any friends here, yet."
0, Have you seen the latest smartwatch?
1, Yes. It's really cool.
0, Do you have one?
0, No. I'm thinking about getting one soon.
0, How much are they?
-1, They are pretty expensive. 
0, I wish I could get one.
0, Why? You never answer your calls or texts.
0," If it's on my wrist, then maybe I will use it."
-1, You're just going to waste your money. 
0, I just read in the newspaper that coffee prevents cancer.
1, Really? That's great news.
0, I know. We drink so much coffee.
1, Let's have another cup right now.
1, Ok. I'll make a fresh pot.
0, I guess not everything causes cancer.
0, I need to introduce you to my new roommate.
0, What is her name?
0, NAME. She's from Spain.
0, What is she doing here?
0, She's a foreign exchange student.
1, That's cool!
1, She's really nice. She has taught me some Spanish words.
0, I'm taking Spanish right now.
1, You should try speaking Spanish to her.
1," I'll try. Hopefully, she won't laugh at me."
0," Good morning, NAME."
0," Good morning, NAME."
0, How did you spend your New Year's Eve?
0, I did the countdown to New Year's with my family. How about you?
0, I worked until 9 pm and met some friends afterwards.
0, You had to work on New Year's Eve?
-1, Yeah. I stayed up until midnight to wish everyone a 'Happy New Year.' Then I went home to sleep. I was so tired. 
0," Why are you up so early? Do you have to work today, too?"
0, No. I'm going to my parents' house. I'm going to watch the Super Bowl on TV with my dad. It's our annual tradition.
0, What is the Super Bowl?
0, You've never heard of the Super Bowl? It's a big American college football game. It's played every January 1.
0, We don't watch that much football in our house.
0, Have you ever watched the Tournament of NAME parade?
0, No. What is that?
1, It's a big parade that is shown before the football game. It's America's New Year celebration.
1, That must be fun.
1, You should watch it. It's an annual American tradition.
1, I think I will.
1," Well, I better go now. Happy New Year, NAME!"
1," Happy New Year, NAME!"
1, I can't believe tomorrow is the first day of the New Year!
1, I know! 2015 went by so fast.
0, It did. Have you made a New Year's resolution yet?
0, What is that?
0, A goal you want to set or achieve in the New Year. Haven't you ever made a New Year's resolution?
0, No. Do you make one every year?
1, Yes!
0, Do you achieve your goal every year?
0," No, I hardly ever achieve them."
0, What were they?
0," One year was losing weight. Another year, I was going to quit smoking. There are too many to list."
0," If you can't achieve them, why do you make one every year?"
0, I should at least try to achieve one goal.
0, Was there ever a successful resolution?
0, Let me think about it. I don't think so.
0, Then your resolution for the New Year should be not to make any more resolutions.
0, Do we have a company dress code?
0, No. The president of the company doesn't care how you dress.
0, Really? You can wear jeans and t-shirts or shorts?
0, Yeah. He only cares about the quality of your work.
1, That's great! We had to wear suits to work every day at my old job.
0, Even on Fridays?
-1, Yeah. Our president was very conservative. 
0, Was that uncomfortable?
-1, Yes! Wearing pantyhose every day is very uncomfortable. 
-1, I know! 
-1, Our company does not have very good perks. 
1, We have vacation time.
1," My friend's company has paid vacation time plus bonuses, retirement plans, gym memberships, maternity leave, and much more."
-1, Wow! We don't get any of those. 
-1, I know! 
0, Maybe we should try to get a job there.
-1, I've tried. I applied three times and had no luck. 
0, Why?
0, There are thousands of applicants every month.
0, Can you direct me to some fresh produce that's on sale?
1," Well, we've got some great mangoes on sale."
0, Mangoes? What are mangoes?
0," Well, it's a fruit with a big seed in it."
0, Can you eat the seed?
0," No. Peel the skin with a sharp knife, and throw out the seed."
0, How much are they?
0," Well, they're on sale today for only $1 each."
0, Can you describe their taste?
1," They usually taste sweet, but they remind me of an orange."
0, How can I tell if they're ripe?
0, You can buy them either ripe or unripe. Unripe ones are hard.
0, Where do they grow mangoes?
0, The ones that are on sale are from Central America.
-1, I'm so stressed right now. 
0, Why? Is there something wrong?
-1, I'm so busy at work. I'm forgetting about my personal life. 
0, I understand. That happened to me too.
0, How do you balance it all out?
0, I just set a strict schedule. Work is work and home is home.
-1, It's not that easy. 
0," I know. But if you don't do that, you're going to get sick."
-1, I think that's my problem. I feel sick all the time. 
0, Are you sick?
-1, No. I just ate too much. 
0, Why do you always eat so much?
-1, I always overeat during the holidays. 
0, You need to control yourself.
1," I know, but Mom's cooking is the best."
0," She made pumpkin pie, your favorite dessert."
-1, I don't think I have room for dessert. 
0, Really? That's the first time I have ever heard you say that.
0, You have to try this.
0, What is it?
0, Stuffed mushrooms.
-1," No, thank you. I don't like mushrooms. "
0, What's wrong with them?
-1, They taste weird and they have a strange texture. 
0, Strange texture?
-1, Feels like a sponge in my mouth. 
0, This is all I made for dinner. You're going to be hungry.
0, I guess I will get something to eat later.
0, Hey NAME. Did you eat lunch?
0," No, I don't have time. I have a big test today at 1 pm."
0, You still need to eat or you won't have energy for the test.
0, I know. I'll grab something on the way to class.
0, Fast food?
0," Yeah, I'll grab a burger."
-1, That's not healthy for you. Let me make you something to eat. 
-1, Thanks. But I don't have time. 
0, You never have the time to eat a proper meal anymore.
1, I like fast food meals anyway. They're quick and easy.
0, Let me pack you some fruits.
0," Mom, please. I'm in college now. I can cut my own fruits."
0, But you won't do it.
1," I'll take this banana. It's quick and easy. See you later, Mom."
1, Eat something nutritious!
-1, I'm sick and tired of the noisy neighbor upstairs. 
-1, His music is so loud. 
-1, Let's talk to the apartment manager again. 
-1, He's not going to do anything. 
0, Then we should move.
-1, But the rent is cheap here. 
-1," Well, we have to choose between cheap rent or a quiet apartment. "
-1, That's a tough choice. 
0," No, it's not. We can find another cheap place."
-1, What if we find another place with a noisy neighbor? 
-1, I can't come to work today. 
0, What's wrong?
-1, I'm not feeling well. 
0, Ok. I'll let the boss know.
-1, Sorry. 
0, Don't be sorry. Just get a lot of rest.
0, What's wrong NAME?
-1, I just found out that I won't be graduating this year. 
0, Why?
-1, I'm a few credits short of the graduation requirements. 
0, What are you going to do?
-1, There's nothing I can do right now. 
0, Have you told your parents?
-1, No way. They are going to be so mad. 
0," Well, you have to tell them."
-1, I know. I just don't know how? My last report card was bad. I promised that I would improve my grades. 
0, Can you go to summer school?
0, I will have to. They're probably going to take my car away.
1," Good luck, buddy."
0, I'm going to need it. Do you have an extra room at your house?
0, Why?
0, I may need that too.
-1, NAME's future with the company is not good. 
0, Why?
-1, He is not meeting our expectations. 
0, Maybe your expectations are too high.
-1, I don't think so. We give all employees many chances. 
0, Are you going to fire him?
0, We will give him one more chance to improve.
0, What if he doesn't?
-1, Then we will have to let him go. 
-1, That's too bad. He had great expectations about this job. 
0, Did you hear the office rumor?
0," No, I didn't. What's happening?"
0, They are going to lay off several people this month.
0, Where did you hear this?
0, I heard it from NAME.
0, Are you worried?
-1, Yes. I am worried. I've only been here for six months. 
-1, Then I should be more worried than you. 
0, Why?

0, How old is it?
0, Ten years?
-1, Ten years. I think that's the problem. 
0, I think you're right. I guess it's time to buy a new one.

-1, That's seems like a waste of time to me. 
1, I love looking for deals without leaving home.
0, What are you doing today?
0," Hi NAME. I'm taking my son to the bank. He got his first paycheck yesterday, so we're going to open a bank account for him."
1, That's a great idea.
1," Yeah, I hope this will teach him how to save money and use it wisely."
0, We did that with our kids too. Is he excited about it?
0, Not really. He wants to spend it all on video games.
1," Well, it's his first paycheck, so I'm sure he wants to spend his own money."
1, I understand that. He knows he can spend it any way he wants to. I just want him to be able to learn how to save some too.
0," Yeah, I totally understand. My first son spent his whole paycheck each time. Now he doesn't have anything saved. My second son saves and saves."
0, I'm hoping NAME saves and saves.
-1, Now my older son always borrows money from his younger brother. 
0, Wow! Does your younger son loan him money?
0," Yeah, but he adds on interest."

0, Did it work?
0," Yeah, but it smelled bad for a few days. They were getting headaches. They came to stay with me."
1," Oh, that's good to know. Maybe we will go stay at a hotel for a few days."
1, You can stay with us if you want.

0, How do you know so much about President's Day?
0, I used to be a history teacher.
0," Honey, close all of the windows and lock the doors."
0, What's going on?
-1, Someone escaped from prison. 
0, Is he dangerous?
-1, The police say he is armed and dangerous. 
-1, I'm scared. 
0," Hey NAME, should we grab a bite to eat before the concert?"
0," Yeah, I'm getting a little hungry."
0, Let's get some fast food here.
0, Burgers and fries?
1," Yeah, that sounds good."
0, Why is the drive-thru line so long?
0, It's dinner time. Should we go inside?
0, It might be busier inside?
0, Looks like the line is really long inside too.
0, Let's head to another place.
0, Can we go to one closer to the concert arena?
1, That's a good idea!
1, There are many fast food places around there.
0," Yeah, we should be able to find one that's not too crowded."
1, Fast food is great. Fast and cheap.
-1, But not very healthy. 
0," NAME, what are you doing?"
0," I'm making posters, Mom. Our school needs to raise money for a field trip."
0, Why do you need to raise money?
0, We want to go on an overnight camping trip and the school doesn't have enough money.
0, How are you going to try to raise money?
0, We are going to have a car wash.
0, A car wash? Where and how?
0, It's going to be at the school parking lot and the students and teachers are going to volunteer to wash cars for donations.
1," That's a great idea! Can parents help, too?"
1, Sure! I'll let my teacher know.
0, When is the car wash?
0, Saturday at noon.
0, What will the weather be like on Saturday?
0, I don't know. I haven't checked.
1," According to the weather report, it's going to be clear and sunny."
1, That's perfect weather for a car wash.
0, How many posters are you going to make?
1, As many as possible. NAME and NAME are coming over to help too.
0, Where are you going to hang these posters?
1, All over town. I hope many people see them.
0, I need to purchase some business cards.
1, No problem. How many are you thinking about?
1," I think 2,000 would be fine."
0," If you'll just fill out this form, please."
1, I want the new cards to be exactly like this card.
1, We can do that very easily.
1, I'm done. Here's the form and my old card.
1, Great. Your order will take only one week.
1," You know, I think it would be better if I could pick it up in three days."
1, We can do that. It'll just cost you extra.
0, Would you like to try this?
0, What is it?
0, Raw oysters.
0," No, thank you."
1, They're delicious.
-1, I don't like anything that is raw. 
0, I have to do a book report.
0, What is the book?
0, I haven't found one yet.
0, How about a classic like NAME NAME?
0, Who wrote that?
0, NAME.
0, I've never heard of him.
0, I can lend it to you.
1, That would be great!
0, I have many other books. You can come by and see what I have.
1, Thank you so much!
0," Have you heard from NAME, the recruiter you met at the networking event?"
0, No.
0, When did you send him your resume?
0, Three weeks ago.
0, Why don't you ask NAME if he received it?
0, I did. I sent him a follow-up email one week later.
0, Did he respond to that?
0, No.
-1," Well, that's rude. "
-1," Yes, rude people. NAME made many promises he didn't keep. "
-1, I never finished college. 
0, Why?
-1, My dad got sick and I had to take care of my mom. 
0, Why didn't you go back to school later?
-1, After my dad died I had to take over the family business. 
0, But you're successful without a college degree.
-1," I know, but I still wish I had a college education. "
0, I understand.
-1, It's my biggest regret in life. 
0, It's not too late to get your degree.
-1, I wish I had studied English more as a kid. 
0, What's wrong with your English now?
-1, My vocabulary isn't very good. 
0, But you know most of the words.
0, I have to look a lot of words up in the dictionary when I read books.
0, Maybe you're reading very difficult books.
0, I'm meeting with an architect today.
0, Why? Are you remodeling your house?
0, No. We are going to remodel the office.
1, That's a good idea. The layout is not very good.
-1, I know. Some areas are too small and some are just a waste of space. 
0, I agree. Can I get a bigger office?
0, I need to place another order of office supplies.
1, I can help you with that.
0, I notice we are paying a lot for delivery charges each month.
0, We can give you a discount depending on how much you order per month.
1, We've been a good customer for over five years.
0," Yes, I see your order history."
0, Can you waive the delivery fee for all future orders?
0, I don't know if I can do that. I will talk to my manager and get back to you.
0," We would love to continue doing business with you, but your delivery fees are too expensive."
0, I understand. I will call you back as soon as possible.
0, Is anyone picking you up at the airport?
0, No. I'm going to rent a car.
0, The boss approved your rental car?
0, Yes. Why?
0, He didn't approve a rental car during my business trip.
0, I found a great deal for a rental car.
0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is NAME. What are you doing today?
-1, I have to go to the mall. I broke my phone. 
0, What happened?
-1, I dropped it outside on the concrete ground. 
-1, Oh no! That's terrible. 
0, I hope it can be fixed or I have to buy a new one.
0, Would you like me to go with you?
0," Sure. If they can't fix it, maybe you can help me pick out a new phone."
0, Ok. Do you want to have lunch together afterwards?
0, I don't think I will have time. I have to pick up my children from school at 3 pm.
0, How about tomorrow?
1, Tomorrow is better. Where do you want to go?
1, You pick the restaurant. It will be my treat since you're having a bad day.
1, Thanks! That's so nice of you.
1, My pleasure. Let's go check out the phone store.
0, Hey NAME. Why do you look so down?
0," Oh, hi NAME. I just got my report card."
0, Is it that bad?
-1," I was hoping to get a good grade in Science class, but I didn't. "
0, That's a hard class.
-1," I know. I did well in all of my other classes, but that one. "
0, You should think about the good grades you received. Don't worry about one class.
-1," I know. But I want to be a scientist. So, this is discouraging to me. "
1, Just study harder next time. You can do it.
1, Thanks for your encouragement. How did you do?
0, I did well. I was most worried about math.
0, How did you do in your math class?
1, Better than I expected. But not a perfect grade.
0, How about science?
0," Oh, I did ok."
0, What does ok mean?
1, I did really well.
-1, I'm happy for you. But I'm sad for myself again. 
0, I need to get some business cards printed up.
0, Do you know how many you need?
0," I think I can get by with 2,000."
1, We can get started as soon as you fill out this form.
0, I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards.
1, You won't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass.
1, I'm through. Here's the form and my old card.
1, Very good. You can pick up your order in one week.
1," Now that I think of it, three days is better than seven."
1," We can do that, but you'll have to pay a little extra."
-1, I need to report lost luggage. 
-1, I'm very sorry that happened. 
0, What do I need to do?
0, Please fill out this lost luggage form.
-1, I have very important business papers in my suitcase. 
-1, I understand. I am very sorry. 
0, Will you contact me as soon as you find it?
0, Yes. We will send it to you right away.
0, I am staying in a hotel downtown.
0, We will contact you as soon as we locate your suitcase.
-1, I'm sorry but can we reschedule our meeting? 
0, Sure. Is something wrong?
-1, My husband is having surgery that day. 
-1, I'm sorry to hear that. 
-1," It's not serious, but I need to stay home with him. "
0, I understand. Let's reschedule when your husband is fully recovered.
0, Can we reschedule the presentation?
0, Again? Why?
-1, We aren't ready. 
0, We already rescheduled once. This will be the second time.
-1," I know, but we're just not ready. "
-1, You've had two months to prepare for this. 
0," I understand that, but we need more time."
0, The clients have been very patient.
-1, Please ask them for one more week. 
-1, You only have one week! 
0, How do you feel about that restaurant?
-1, It wasn't all that great. 
0, What did you dislike the most?
-1, I don't think that they had their act together. They didn't seem well prepared. 
0, Did you think that the food was any good?
-1, I wasn't all that impressed by the food. 
1, The service certainly could have been better.
-1, The service did not help the situation. 
0, Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to?
-1, I am not really interested in trying this restaurant again. 
0," Welcome, what would you like to order?"
0, I would like to get a double cheeseburger.
0, Would you like everything on it?
1," I would like everything on it, thank you."
0, Do you want any fries?
0, Let me get some large curly fries.
0, Can I get you anything to drink?
1," Sure, how about a medium Pepsi?"
0, Is that everything?
1, That'll be all. Thanks.
1," You're welcome, and your total is $5.48."
1, Thank you. Here you go.
0, What can I get for you?
0," Hello, may I have a double cheeseburger?"
0, With everything on it?
1, That sounds great.
0, Did you want fries with your order?
0, May I get a large order of curly fries?
0, Did you want something to drink?
0, Get me a medium Pepsi.
0, Would you like anything else?
0," No, thank you. That's it."
0," No problem, that'll be $5.48."
1, Thanks a lot. Keep the change.
0, How may I help you?
1, A double cheeseburger sounds good.
0, Everything on it?
1," Yes, please."
0, Would you like fries with that?
1, I would love large curly fries.
0, Would you like anything to drink?
0," Yes, let me have a medium Pepsi."
0, Will that be all?
1," Yeah, that's it. Thank you."
0, Your total comes to $5.48.
1, Here you go. Thank you very much.
-1, I have bad news. 
0, What is it?
-1, We are laying you off. 
-1, Why? I thought I was doing a good job. 
0, The company is restructuring and we're getting rid of your position.
-1, This is terrible. I just bought a home. 
0, Are you going to NAME's retirement party?
0, No. Are you?
0, I don't know. I don't think many people are going.
-1, He isn't a very nice person and he's a mean boss. 
-1, I know. I remember when he yelled at me for being 10 minutes late to a presentation. 
0, Weren't you in a car accident that morning.
-1, Yeah. I was pretty angry. 
-1, He would yell at people for unnecessary reasons. 
-1, Why is the company throwing him a retirement party? 
0," I don't know. I think his secretary, NAME, is planning it."
-1, She must be crazy. 
1," Maybe she is happy he is leaving, so she wants to have a party."
1, That's funny. Then we should all go.
0, Maybe we should.
1, That's a sad way to retire.
0, What is a sad way to retire?
1, To retire with no one liking you.
1, You're right. Maybe we should go to the party and say goodbye.
0, I have to plan for my retirement.
0, Have you thought about investing in stocks?
-1," Yeah, but stocks can be risky. "
-1, I know. My brother lost a lot of money in stocks. 
-1, That's what I'm worried about. 
1," However, I also know a few people who made a lot of money investing in stocks."
0, I guess it's a gamble.
0, You have to be smart.
0, You also have to be lucky!
1, That's right!
0, I need to order new business cards.
0, Do you have any idea how many you'd like?
1," I think 2,000 would be enough."
0," Would you fill out this form, please?"
-1, I don't want to make any changes to my old card. 
1," If you detect any difference, I'll take you out to dinner."
1," That's it. Here's the form, and here's my old card to use as a model."
1, Thank you. Your order will be ready seven days from now.
0," I need it sooner. Let me have it in three days, okay?"
1," We can certainly give you faster turnaround, but it will cost you extra."
0," Hi NAME, how was your first day at a new school?"
1," It was ok, Mom."
0, Did you make any new friends?
0, Yeah. A boy in my class.
0, Is he nice? What's his name?
1, He's cool. His name is NAME. He plays soccer.
1, You love soccer. You were on the soccer team at your old school.
-1," Yeah, I miss my old team with NAME, NAME, and NAME. "
0, I know you do. Do you want to invite NAME over to play one day?
1, Sure. He rides the school bus on our street.
0, Do you want to start riding the school bus too.
0, Yeah. Then I can meet more of the neighborhood kids.
0, Ok. Let's plan for you to ride the bus tomorrow morning.
0, NAME said the bus comes at 7:45.
0, Then you need to wake up at 7 o'clock.
0, I know. I'll set my alarm.
0, Turn on the news.
0, What happened?
-1, There is a bank robbery going on. 
0, Where?
0, On Main Street.
0, I was just there an hour ago.
-1, You got lucky. The robbers are still inside with hostages. 
-1, That's scary! I hope no one gets hurt. 
-1, The robbers are demanding money and a helicopter. 
0, What about the hostages?
0," Hey, NAME, is NAME coming with us?"
0, Yes. Why?
0, Nothing. I'm just asking.
-1," Just asking? But why is your face burning like mad? Ah-huh, someone has a crush on NAME, doesn't he? "
0, Who has a crush?!
1," Come on, NAME, don't be such a chicken. If you like her, you've got to tell her. Maybe she likes you."
-1," Well, I don't have the guts to ask her out. "
0, What're you so afraid of? Just tell her what you're feeling about her.
-1, I'd totally die if she turned me down. 
1," But that's better than keeping everything to yourself. You've got to let her know. Come on! You've got to take a chance! Even though you are rejected, it's not the end of the world! There's nothing to lose, is there?"
-1," I don't know....Well, maybe, you're right, but how am I going to tell her? "
0," NAME, I know you like NAME a lot, but what do you like about him?"
0," Well, I don't know, but there's just something about him. Don't you think so?"
0, Really? What's that something?
1," Well, he's gentle, patient, successful, and MATURE. I think He's my Mr. Right!"
-1," MATURE is a good word, but don't you think he's a little old for you? He's almost twice as old as you are! "
1," Well, age shouldn't be something that comes in the way of a person's marriage. As long as we love each other, age is not an issue."
0, But what will others think?
1," I don't care what others will think about us. I just know I love him and he loves me, and that's all that matters."
0," Hi, NAME, long time, no see!"
0, Yeah! How's everything going?
1, Not bad! At least I'm still alive.
1, Just alive? I guess you're some lucky guy. I heard you're going out with NAME.
0, Where did you get that idea?
1," Oh, come on. NAME is a very nice girl, someone you meet only once in a lifetime."
1," You're right. I'm not boasting, but she's really as beautiful as she is intelligent."
1," Well, I really envy you for finding such a nice girl."
0, I heard you're going out with NAME?
1," Yes. To be frank, I really love him to death."
1, You're so lucky!
0, Why do you say that?
1," Why? Are you kidding me? A guy like him is hard to find. Few boys are so caring, so patient, and, did I mention, he's a hottie?"
0, You really think so?
1," Totally! I'm saying it from the bottom of my heart! And it's obvious that he's head over heels in love with you, too."
1, I sure hope so!
0," Hi, NAME, how have you been?"
-1, Not very well. 
-1, Why? Looks like you're feeling very down! What happened? 
0, Nothing.
0," Come on. For a man who's feeling so down, there're usually two reasons. Either his career is going downhill, or he has a broken heart. Since you're so successful, it must be the other."
-1," Well, you're right. I just broke up with NAME. "
-1," Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you two were made for each other. "
-1," Well, you never know. I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down, but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young. "
0," Well, you can't blame her. It's always difficult to choose between career and family."
0, Maybe you're right.
1," NAME, I don't know what to say to comfort you, but cheer up! There's plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate, your perfect match!"
-1," Yeah, but it's hard to forget her at the moment. You know, we were together for almost five years. It's really hard.... "
1," Hi, B, we're having a party tonight, wanna come join us? You can bring your girlfriend."
-1, Well...I'm breaking up with NAME. 
0, What happened? Did you have a fight?
1, No. She's really a very nice girl....
1," Yeah, she is. She's pretty, caring, and easy-going. And she's a great cook! She's a gem!"
-1," Well, you're right. But sometimes she's too caring... well...no...she's just possessive...and...uh... I kind of want a break...you know...for some room for myself. "
0, Oh?! Did you talk with her about it?
-1," I've tried, but...it didn't work. "
0," Oh. So, when are you going to tell her?"
-1, Maybe tonight. I don't know. I don't know how to tell her. 
-1, I know she's head over heels in love with you. She'll be badly hurt! 
-1, I know.... 
-1," NAME, I'm very upset about something. Can I talk with you? I'd like your opinion. "
0," What is it about? Oh, is it about NAME?"
-1," Yeah, sort of.... "
0," So, what's up?"
0," What do you think of NAME, NAME?"
0," What do I think of him? You know him better than I do, don't you?"
-1," Please, don't tease me. Just tell me. "
0," Well, remember the other day when you said that NAME is a man who really shows you nothing but consideration?"
0, Uh-hunh...
0, And remember you said that he really makes you happy?
-1, Yeah. (Heave a sigh) NAME is indeed a gentleman. He has wonderful manners and is respectful of me. But I'm really bothered by his past! 
0, His past!? Was he an ex-con or something?
-1," No, no, no. That's not what I mean. He used to have a girlfriend and he loved her very much. He almost married her if it were not for an accident. "
0," Oh, I see. But why are you so bothered? That's already a history, isn't it?"
-1, I know. But I just can't get it off my mind. 
1," Come on, NAME. You're just being a little jealous, but that's just fine. You know, when you love him, you've got to love his past, his everything.... You've got to love him as a whole."
0," Hi, NAME. Haven't seen you for a while? How is NAME?"
-1, We're not seeing each other any more. 
0, What happened? Did you break up?
-1, Yeah. I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time. 
-1," Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe, you were just emotional at that moment. Do you think you guys can get back together? "
0, I don't know. There's plenty of fish out there in the sea.
-1," Oh, you're such a dog! "
-1, I'm about to run out of business cards. I need some new ones. 
1, We can print as many as you like. Just tell me how many.
1, Two thousand should get me through the year.
0, Here's a form to get you started.
1," My old card is perfect, so all I want you to do is copy it exactly."
1, I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card.
0," Here you go, your form and my old business card."
1," Thanks. Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order, please."
0," I'm sorry, but can you give me a three-day turnaround?"
1," If you don't mind paying a little extra, it's absolutely no problem."
-1, I am so mad! My kids were playing in our yard and they stepped in dog poop. 
0, You don't have a dog.
0, I know. Someone is leaving dog poop in our yard.
-1, That's terrible. 
-1, It has happened twice already. 
0, What are you going to do?
0, I'm going to set up a secret video recorder in our yard.
0, What are you going to do when you find out who it is?
-1, I'm going to deliver their dog's mess to them and show them the video. 
-1, They are going to be so embarrassed. 
0, Hey NAME. What are you doing here?
0, Hi NAME. I need to buy some stamps. What about you?
-1," I was checking my post office box, but my key won't work. "
0, Do you know why?
-1, I think they canceled my account because I forgot to pay. 
-1, That's too bad. 
-1, Yeah. I use it for my business. 
0, How long have you been waiting?
0, I've been here since 8 am.
0, That's 30 minutes.
-1, I know. It's been a long wait. 
-1, There are still several people ahead of us. 
-1, Many people left. They were tired of waiting. 
-1, I don't think I can wait either. I have a dentist appointment at 9 am. 
-1, I'm going to wait. I need to re-open my account. 
0, Yeah. I understand. I'm going to come back later.
0, Ok. See you another time.
0, Bye NAME.
0, What kind of work do you do?
0, I run my own business.
0, What kind of business?
0, I have a website that teaches English to non-native speakers.
1, Wow! That's cool! How do you make money?
0," Advertisements, downloads, and software purchases."
0, Hey NAME. What are you doing?
0, Nothing much. What are you up to?
-1, I was just concerned about NAME. He hasn't been himself lately. 
-1, He took the civil service exam and failed. 
-1, That sucks. He must feel depressed. 
-1, Yeah. He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days. 
0, Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him.
1, That's a great idea. Why don't you call him? I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else.
1, Ok. I'll call you back after I'm done.
1, Sounds good.
-1, NAME. You look terrible. What's wrong? 
-1, My grandmother just passed away. 
-1, I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this happen? 
-1, A couple of days ago. I just got back from the funeral. 
0, Is there anything I can do?
-1, No... not really. The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died. I really wanted to be there one last time. 
0, I'm sure she knew you loved her. Did she pass away in the hospital?
-1, Yeah. She died in her sleep. 
-1, I'm sorry she's gone. 
1, I am interested in selling my home and would like to know what is involved.
1, You have come to the right place. When were you interested in selling your home?
0, I just received a job transfer and need to relocate right away.
0, How long have you been in your current home?
0, I have lived in my home for about 10 years.
0," As I am sure that you are aware, the market has fallen in the past year. People are more likely to make money if they have owned their home for a while."
0, Will I be able to recover the money I paid for my home?
0," It is hard to say, but whatever house you buy will also be costing you a lot less."
0, What is the next step in selling my home?
1," I would like to meet with you tomorrow to look at your property, and then you and I can figure out a contract."
0, I am looking for a realtor to help me sell my home.
1, I would be happy to help you with any questions that you might have. When you thinking of selling your home?
0," I am interested in moving up to a bigger home, but first I need to sell the one I now own."
0, Have you owned your home for a long time?
0, I just bought my home two years ago.
0, I think you probably know that the market is not all that great. You are more likely to see a profit if you have owned for 8 years or more.
0, Will I be losing money if I sell right now?
0," It is impossible to predict with certainty what will happen, but you can purchase a replacement home at a lower rate also."
0, What can I do next to get the ball rolling on this sale?
0," If it works for you, I would like to come over and see your home. Then we can draw up a contract."
0, I am considering selling my home and would like information on doing so.

0, Do you have any clue who might have done this?
-1, I have a feeling that it might have been the neighborhood kids. 
0," Why, what leads you to that suspicion?"

0, I saw them playing just before I left my apartment.
0," Well, did you recognize any of them?"
-1," No, I just took a quick look. "

0," Well, there are a lot of factors involved in setting an asking price."

0," We need to look at the selling prices for similar homes in the area. These will vary according to the condition of the home, specific location, and lot size."
0, Do I have to use the comparisons as the asking price for my house?
0," No, but a seller is not going to be able to get a loan if the selling price is a lot higher that what an appraiser feels the home is worth."
1, Isn't it better to price my house really high and see what I can get?
0, You shouldn't set the price of the house unrealistically high. Oftentimes buyers are put off by this practice.

0, The comparisons to other similar homes in your area give us a good indication of what your home is worth.
-1, Is the price that we get by looking at comparisons necessarily the asking price that I have to use for my home? 
0," You don't have to use that particular asking price, but the buyer is going to have trouble getting a loan if the house is priced too high."
0," Should I just shoot for the moon and, if I have to lower the price, do it later?"
0," You should be realistic in your pricing. Otherwise, many potential buyers just walk away."
0, Can we lower the asking price later if we need to?

0, What do you think the asking price of my home should be?
0, There are many things to take into consideration when pricing a home.

0," You don't have to use the price from the comparisons as your asking price. However, you must be realistic in what you ask."
0, I think that I am going to set the price really high so that I have room to bargain with the buyers.
0," Don't go overboard in trying to get top dollar. More often than not, that strategy backfires."
0, Is it okay to lower the asking price if the first price isn't bringing in any offers?
0," If the market doesn't support your asking price, we can always re-evaluate our pricing and adjust it."
0, My wife thinks I should get a lawyer to look at the contract.
0," Well, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a lawyer review it."
0, How much does a lawyer cost?
0, I don't know. A good real estate lawyer might cost $400 an hour.

0, Just think how much it'll be 10 years from now.
0, Do you know any lawyers that are cheaper than that?

0," The lawyer will start at $400, but where will it end?"
0," Also, a good lawyer might not have time to see you immediately."
-1," My wife's going to kill me, but just show me where to sign. "
0, Now you're talking. The red stickers indicate where to sign and date.

1, Lighter neutral colors are usually best. They make rooms appear larger.

1, That's a great offer!
1," Yes, it is a good offer. Before you accept, we should look at some details."
0, What else do we need to look at?
0," They want you to pay all closing costs. Of course, they are making the sale contingent on an inspection showing no major defects in the house."
1, I think that that sounds fair.
0," You could put in a counteroffer, but I know that these buyers also have their eye on another house down the street."
1, I definitely want to accept their offer.
1, Excellent decision! I will notify them immediately.
1, I am so anxious to hear what the bid was on our house!
0, Remember that we set the asking price at three hundred thousand dollars. The first offer is two hundred ninety thousand dollars.
1, That's way better than I expected so early in the game!
1," The offer is definitely a good one, but let's make sure we look at the whole picture."
0, What are the other considerations?
0," They want you to pay for the inspection, but they want to pick out the inspector. If the house is defective, they will want out of the deal."
1, I don't have a problem with that.
0," You could make them a counteroffer, but I know that you need a timely sale."
1, Please notify the buyers that I have accepted their offer.
0, Do you know where they sell old music boxes?
0, How about a flea market?
0, A flea market? What's that?
0, A flea market is a big outdoor place where you can buy all sorts of second-hand things.

1, All of that is acceptable to me.
0," A counteroffer by you is always a possibility, but their price is very close to your asking price. You could risk losing the sale."

0, I hear the young couple that came by the other day made an offer on our house.
0," Yes, the potential buyers made an offer this morning."

0, They also want the sale contingent on a good building inspection.
1," That is reasonable, and I accept those conditions."

0, We can accommodate the buyer's desire for an escrow length of their choosing.
0, They want their building inspector to approve the quality of the house.
1, I would expect that to be the case and accept their counteroffer.

0, I was calling to see if the buyers had accepted my counteroffer.
0," Yes, actually they just called back with a counteroffer of their own."
0, Is the counteroffer close to the asking price?
0, The counteroffer is for ten thousand less than your asking price.
-1, I didn't really want to go that low in my pricing. 
1," I agree that that price is too low. Your home is in good shape, and you should get a better price for it."
0, What should I do at this point?
0," Since you don't want to go any lower, we can notify them that you are rejecting their latest offer."
0, Can you take care of that for me and get back to me?
0, I will let them know that your counteroffer was the lowest price that you will accept.
0, Has there been any word about whether the buyers have accepted my counteroffer?
0," Yes, I was going to call you this morning. Your buyers have responded with a counteroffer."
0, Is the counteroffer a good one?
0, They are now offering ten thousand less than your asking price.
-1, That is really a bit lower in price than I would like to go.

0," Yes, we received three offers in one day for your home!"
0, Were the offers for a good price?
0," One offer was for the full asking price, one slightly below, and one above."
1," Well, I am going to accept the highest bid, of course!"
0, Actually there are a few things to consider other than who is offering the most money.
0, What other factors do I need to consider?
0, We need to consider the likelihood of the buyers actually being able to purchase the house.
0, How do we check on the buyer's ability to purchase our home?
0, We will check to see if these buyers are pre-qualified for the loan amount that they need. This information will help you make a good decision.
0," When we get all of that information, then I will make my decision."
0," When you make that decision, I will present it to the buyers."
0, I received your e-mail about the many purchase offers for my house.
1, It has been quite a busy day regarding your home. We just received three offers!
0, Did the potential buyers offer a good price?
0," There were offers above and below your asking price, as well as one exactly for the asking price."
1, The highest bid is always the best bid!
0, We need to look at the big picture in deciding which bid to accept.
0, What things would you like me to look at?
0, Just because a buyer offers the money doesn't mean that they actually have the credit to purchase the home.
0, How do I get the information about a buyer's ability to afford to buy a home?
0, We will check to see if any of these buyers have a large down payment. A large amount of available cash would be a good sign.
0, I will wait for that information and give you my answer.
0," Please let me know when you have made your decision, and I will contact the buyers."
0, My friend said that you had called regarding multiple offers for my home.

1, I am anxious to hear how good an offer we received!
0, Offers above and below the asking price came in. One was right on the money.
1, Let's go with the highest bid!
0, We need to look at a number of factors in deciding which bid to go with.
0, What matters besides getting the money for the house?
0, We need to make sure that these potential buyers all actually qualify to even purchase a home.
0, I don't even know where to begin checking on a buyer's credit information.
0, We can check to see if these buyers have already sold their current home.
1, I think that gathering that information will be helpful to me.
0, Please let me know if I can further assist you in making your decision.
0, Do you have any idea where I can buy old music boxes?
1, You can find almost anything at a flea market.
0, What in the world is a flea market?
0," A flea market sells all kinds of used things, some that you've never even heard of."
1, Great. Is there one near here?
1," Actually, our local community college has one on the first Sunday of each month."
1, I heard that the potential buyer is interested in me carrying part of a loan for him.
0," Carrying part of a loan can be a good or a bad thing, depending on the circumstances."
0, What would be an advantage of me carrying a note on the house?
1," If you don't need the money right away, you can earn a fairly good interest rate."
0, Why does my buyer want me to carry part of his loan?
0," In this economy, buyers sometimes have trouble getting a loan even when they have good credit."
0, What are the risks to me?

0, I thought you just bought a pair.
1, I did.
0, What's wrong with them so soon?

-1, You shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket. 
0, But that's what pockets are for.
0, You should carry them in a purse.
-1," I'm a man, and men don't carry purses! "

0, I would if I could find someone who makes strong pockets.
0, Try a Google search online.
0, What are those wipes for?
0, You use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.
1, That's a great idea.
0," Yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers."

0, Like what?
0," Well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents."
1, That's a good deal.
0, And a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
1, Another good deal.
1, But the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.

1," Neither do I, but they're doing something right."
0, I need a new computer.
0, What's the matter with yours?

-1,A : B look at my nose! It's rather flat. I want to be like yours! 
1, Oh come on! Don't say that Elys. You're pretty enough.
-1," I hate my nose. I want to have a pointed nose, so I'll be much more beautiful than now. "
1, What did you say! It's a blessing Elys! You should count your blessings!
1, I do! I just want to look more beautiful. I will have plastic surgery. I must save my money for it.
-1," But, it's risky Elys! "
-1," B, isten to me, please. Now is technology era! If we want to be good looking, we can't just rely on cosmetics only. Use the technology! Be smart B! You can also whiten your skin, slim your body instantly, and many more! "

0, Do you want to join me?
1, Sure. Which one are you going to?
0, ABC Grocery. I have coupons for that market.

0, I know. I use their coupons all the time.
0," So, do you have any?"
-1, No. I think I used them all. Where did you get your coupons?

0, Is it cheaper?
1, It is much cheaper than bookstores.
0, How much is shipping?
1, Shipping is free!
0, May I help you?
0, Yes. Do you have these shoes in size seven?
0," I'm not sure. If you can't find them on the rack, they may be out of stock. But let me look in the stockroom."
1, Thanks. I'd like to try on a pair if you have them.
0, I'll be right back.
0, How much did you pay for it?
0, 200 bucks.
-1, 200 bucks for a piece of junk like that? That's a rip-off! 
0, What do you mean?
-1, It's not worth it. 
-1, Oh. I guess I really did get ripped off. 
0," Hi, are you being helped?"
1," No, I'm not. I'm interested in some scarves."
0, All our scarves are in this section. What do you think of this one here? It's made of silk.
1," Hm, it looks nice, but I'd like to have something warm for the winter."
1, Maybe you would like a heavy wool scarf. How about this one?
1, I think that's what I want. How much is it?
0, It's seventy-five dollars plus tax.
-1, It's a little expensive. Do you think it's possible to get a discount? 
1," Hm, since you like it so much, how about a 10 percent discount. That's the best I can offer."
1, That's good. Could you wrap it up for me?
0, Sure. Is there anything else I can get for you?
1," No, that should be it. Thank you."
0," Hi, can I help you?"
0," No, thanks. I'm just looking."
0," All right. If you need any help, just let me know. My name is A ."
1," Sure. I'll let you know if I need anything. Hm, this mattress is very firm. NAME will probably like it."
0, Did you find something you like?
1," Yes, this mattress is very good. It's pretty firm. The mattress I'm now sleeping on is saggy."
1," You're right. This is a very good brand. It doesn't sag easily. And we offer a life-time warranty, so you don't have to worry about its quality."
0, Does it come with a frame?
0," Unfortunately, it doesn't. However, we could offer a ten percent discount on that. And also, if you're really interested, we have a very good financing plan here. There's no payment, no interest until next June."
1, That's an attractive plan. I'll think about it.
1," Well, you've got to hurry. This mattress sells pretty well and this promotion ends tomorrow."
0, Is there anything else you would like to buy?
-1," No, thank you. I guess that's it. By the way, in case there's a flaw in this CD player, can I return it? "
0, Yes. But you must return it within 30 days.
0, Is there a charge for that? I know other stores have a restocking fee.
0," There will be no charge at all. However, you must show us the receipt. (The cashier is handing the receipt over to B for him to sign.) Could you sign it here, please?"
1, Thank you.
1," All right. Keep your receipt. If something comes up, you can show it to us and we'll give you a refund."
1, Thanks. I'll put it in a safe place.
0," B , do you want to come to the mall with me?"
-1," I'd love to, but I'm broke. "
1," So am I, but I like browsing through the music store there."
0, Are you sure you only want to browse?
1," Yeah. I like to listen to new albums there. I don't have money to buy them, but I can go there and listen. You know you don't have to pay for listening."
0, You are right.
0," B , Highland Mall is having a big sale this weekend. You wanna go?"
-1, Don't feel like it. I'm broke. 
1," Well, we can still do some window shopping, can't we?"
-1," Just look around? Nah, that's boring. "
0, I'll go myself then.
1," Look at this catalog, B . I think I want to get this red blouse."
0, Don't you have one like this in blue?
-1," Yeah, but I don't have a red one. "
-1, Do you need every color in the rainbow? 
1, (Looking at her husband dumbly.) Yes!
-1, (The husband shakes his head.) Tsk...tsk...women! 
0,"A : B, will you go for the savings gathering today?"
0," Yes I will. I haven't got my turn yet, hopefully, today I can get my money."
-1," I haven't either! But I don't like such a gathering, just waste my time. "
0, Why do you think so? So why do you join it since the first place?
-1, I just couldn't refuse their offer. 
0, How many times have you come for the gathering?
0, Just once.
1, really? I don't come frequently either. But I come more than that. If Iâ€™m not busy I'll always come there.
-1, I don't want to go there anyway. So please can you just give my money to them? 
1," Oh my dear, it's good for us for socializing. Since everybody is busy, it can be an apportunity for us to meet each other while we can also save some money."
0, Do we?
1," Yes of course! If you have talent in selling, it perhaps good also for you to market your things."
1," Oh sounds great! Yeah, I have some jewelry. They may buy it. You right!"
0," Hi B . I'm A , your new client."
1," Nice to meet you, A ."
1," Nice to meet you too, B ."
0, Have you taken a tour of the office yet?
0," No, not yet."
0, Would you like me to show you around?
1, That would be great!
0, Let's start with my office. It's at the end of the hallway.
1, You have a view of the mountains.
1," Yes, it's a relaxing view in a stressful industry."
0, I understand the stress part.
0, Hello?

0, Wow! I hope NAME isn't sick that long.
0, There's a virus going around. We need to stay healthy too.
0, I know. I've been taking extra Vitamin C to stay healthy.
1, Good idea! I think I'll buy some today. Do you need anything at the store?
-1," Actually, I do. I couldn't go to the store because I didn't want to leave NAME alone. "
0, I understand. What do you need?
0, Could you please buy me a whole chicken? I want to make NAME some chicken soup.
1, That's a great idea! I'll drop it off on my way home.
1, Thank you so much! I will pay you back when you drop off the chicken.
1, Ok! I'm going to go to the store after lunch. I will be at your house around 2 pm.
1, Great! See you then. Don't forget to buy Vitamin C!

0, What's wrong with it?

0," Hi A. No, this is a rental car. I was in an auto accident yesterday."
0, Are you ok?
1," Yeah. My back hurts a little, but luckily I wasn't seriously injured."

1, Yeah. He seemed ok at the scene.
-1, This could've been a serious accident. 
1, I know. We were both lucky.
0, Where is your car? Is it getting fixed?
-1, No. It's too damaged to be repaired. It's at the junkyard now. 
-1, That's terrible. Is your insurance going to pay for a new car? 
0," Well, it was the other driver's fault, so his insurance is going to take care of it."
1, That's good. Are you going to buy the same type of car?
1, I think so. I loved that car. It protected me in this accident.

0, Not every day. Only a couple of times a week.
0," Well, I think the bus is late today because of the rain."
0, Oh. Does the weather make a difference?
0, Yes. The bus is usually several minutes late when it rains.
0, Because of bad traffic?
0, Yeah and probably because of car accidents.
0, That makes sense. I must have picked the wrong day to ride the bus.
1," Actually, I think riding the bus on rainy days is better."
0, Why?
0, Then you don't have to drive in bad traffic. Someone is driving for you.
1, You are totally right! I'm going to check the weather from now on. I'm going to take the bus when it rains.

0, Something tells me it might be some of the kids in the complex.
-1, What led you to think it might be the kids in this building? 
0, I found a baseball near the broken glass.
0," Well, you can't ignore a baseball in your living room, can you?"
0, I saw them in the lot just before I went out.
0, Do you know any of them?
-1," No, I didn't pay any attention to who they were. "
0," I'll call the window repairman, but it'll probably take a couple of days."
0, I could get fast service if I call a friend of mine.
0, I don't have a problem with that. Let me look at the damage first.
0," Okay, I'm waiting for you. But who does my friend give the bill to?"
-1," Since the kids broke it, your friend can bill me. "
0, Whew! I was worried that I would have to pay for it.
-1,A : The patient next door has passed away. 
0," I heard that he should get the next treatment, didn't he?"
-1," Yeah, but the doctor said that he suffers incurable disease. "
-1, Poor him. How long had he been sick before finally died? 
-1," He had been sick for more than 8 years. But, I tell you something. Come closer, please. "
0, What?
-1, Someone told me that he actually asked for euthanasia. Euthanasia is a medical action done by doctor towards patient with incurable disease to end the patient's suffering peacefully. 
-1, Oh what! Euthanasia?! Oh my! Do you know that it is against the human right? It's only allowed for animals! 
-1, But I myself feel sorry for someone with incurable illness who has been suffering for long time. 
-1," If public knows about this, it will be a big problem for the doctor. "
-1," I don't think so, since the doctor has got the patient's will and agreement. "
-1, I have no idea. 
0," Hi, how are you doing?"
1, I'm fine. How about yourself?
1, I'm pretty good. Thanks for asking.

0, You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
0," In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining."
0, That wouldn't seem right.

0, How come?
1, You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
1, I would love for it to rain today.
1, I would too.
1, I really want to go to the beach this weekend.
1, That sounds like fun. What's the weather going to be like?
0, I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
0, Is it going to be perfect beach weather?
1, I believe so.
1, Good. I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.

0," Yeah, are you going to come?"
-1," I'm sorry, I can't. "
0, Why not?
-1, I don't really want to. 
0," Well, why don't you?"
-1, I hate going to parties. 
0," Well, that's okay."
-1," Yeah, sorry. "
0, What's up?
0," Nothing, how about you?"
0," Next Saturday, I'm going to have a party."
0," Oh, really?"
0, You are coming?
0, Probably not.
0, Why is that?
-1, I don't feel like going. 
0, Why not?
-1, I really can't stand going to parties. 
0," I understand, I guess."
-1, Sorry about that. 
0, What's happening?
0," Not a lot, what about you?"
0, I'm having a party next Saturday.
1, That's nice.
0, Are you going to be there?
0, I don't think so.
0, Is there a reason why?
-1, I just really don't want to go.

0, Yes. Who told you that?
0, A friend of ours told me.
0, Why are you asking?
0, I was asking because I found an apartment.
0, Why are you telling me this?
0, I was wondering if you wanted to sublease with me.
1, I sure would!
0," Since we're subleasing, we can each pay half of the rent."
0, How much is the rent each month?
0, It's $1000 a month.
1, That's wonderful.
0," Hey, what's good with you?"
0, Not a lot. What about you?
0, I'm throwing a party on Friday.
1, That sounds like fun.
0, Do you think you can come?

1, I'd better see you there.
1, All right. I'll see you next time.
0, What's going on?
0, Nothing really. How about you?
0," A lot, like the party I'm having on Friday."
1," Well, that's cool."
0, Will you be able to make it?

1, It was nice talking to you.
0, Why are you trying to rush me off the phone?
0, I really have to go.
1, Why? I still wanted to talk to you.
0, I have things to do.
0, Like what?
0, Don't be nosey.
0, I'm not. I just want to know.
-1," Well, it's really none of your business. "
-1, That's harsh. 
-1," I'm sorry, but I have to go. "
0, Fine.
1, I've enjoyed conversing with you.
0, Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast?
0, I've got to go.
0, I wasn't done talking to you.
-1," I have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite to be nosey. "
-1, I'm not being nosey. I'm just asking. 
-1, I really don't think it's any of your business. 
-1, That's not nice. 
-1," I apologize, but I'm getting off the phone now. "
0, Okay.
0, I'll talk to you later.
0, What's the rush?
0, I have to get off the phone now.
0, I'm not ready to get off the phone with you.
0, There are other things I need to take care of.
0, What is it that you need to do?
-1, Please don't be nosey. 
0," I'm not being nosey, it's just a question."
-1, You don't need to worry about that. 
-1, That was mean to say. 
-1," I am very sorry, but I must go. "
0, I guess.
1," Well, it was nice talking to you."
1, It was nice talking to you too.
0, We should really hang out again.
1, That would be fun.
0, Where do you want to go?
0, I think we should go out to eat.
1, That sounds good.
1," All right, so I'll see you then."
1, I'll call you later.
1," Okay, I'll talk to you later then."
1, I enjoyed talking to you.
1, I enjoyed talking to you too.

0, I think we should really do something sometime.
1, That should be loads of fun.
0, What do you want to do next time?
0, Would you like to go to dinner or something?
1," Yeah, let's do that."
0, I'm thinking about getting a smartwatch.
0, Do you know how to use one?
0," No, but I can learn."
0, You don't even know how to use your smartphone.
1, My son has a smartwatch. It looks cool.
0, Maybe you should learn how to use your phone first.
0," Hi, I haven't seen you in a while."
0," Yes, it has been a long time."
0, How long has it been since we last saw each other?
0, I think that we last saw each other two years ago.
0, What have you been doing for the past two years?
0, I have been going to graduate school at USC.
0, What are you majoring in?
0, I am studying international communications.
1, You should easily be able to find a job with that major.
1, I am counting on being able to get a good job.
0, Are you still looking for an apartment?
0, Who said I was?
0, One of our friends let me know.
0, Why would you want to know?
0, I found an apartment for lease.
0, So what?
0, I wanted to know if you would sublease the apartment with me.
1, That would be great!
1," That's great, because this way we can go halves on the rent."
0, What's rent?
1," It's $1,000 each month, but it'll only cost us $500 a month each."
1, I like the sound of that.
0," Hello, it's been a long time since I have seen you."
0, It is true that I have not seen you in a while.
0, Exactly how long do you think that it has been?
0, I believe that it has been two years since we last saw each other.
0, So where have you been since I last saw you?
0, I am working on my doctorate at USC.
0, What is your field of emphasis?
0, I decided to pursue international communications.
1, I think that you will be very employable after you finish your degree.
1, I hope that when I finish I will find good work.
0, It has certainly been a long time since I saw you last.
0, It has been a long time since I last saw you.
0, Can you remember when we last saw each other?
0, It was about two years ago that we saw each other.
0, What have you been up to for the past two years?
0, I am finishing up my doctorate at USC.
0, What subject did you decide to study?
0, International communications is my field.
1, That sounds like a very marketable degree.
1, I am expecting to get my degree and find an interesting position.
1," NAME, what a great dinner party!"
1," Thank you, NAME. What would you like to drink with your meal? I can offer you wine, mango juice, or water."

0, NAME and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by.
1, I am so glad that you decided to stop by!
0," Yes, it has been a long time since we have seen you."
0," NAME, can I get NAME or you something to drink?"
0," Oh no, thank you. We aren't all that thirsty."
0, How about a little snack then?
0," No, thank you, we just ate lunch a little while ago."
0," Well then, how is your family?"
1, Everyone is doing great. My sister finally had her baby.
1," NAME, what a surprise!"
1, I am so glad you are home! NAME and I thought that we'd take a chance and stop by for a visit.
1, Your timing is perfect!
0, It's been a long time since we've stopped by.
0," NAME, NAME, would either of you like something to drink?"
1," Thanks, but we really are fine."
0, Would you like a little snack?
0," No, thanks. We are still full from lunch."
0, Is your family doing well?
1, Things are going well for everyone. My brother finally got the job he had been trying for.
0," NAME, how have you been?"
0, NAME and I just took a chance on our way home from the beach to see if you were up for visitors.
1, I was just thinking about you yesterday!
1, It's been ages since we had a chance to visit with you!
0," NAME, please let me get the two of you something to drink."
0," Oh, please don't go to any trouble. We just stopped by for a visit."
0, Can I get you a little something to eat?
0," We appreciate the offer, but we already ate."
0," So tell me, how is your family doing?"
1, We are all doing well. My dad finally got to retire and is enjoying his leisure time.
0," Hi NAME, how are things going?"
1," Everything is great, NAME. How are you?"
1, I'm doing really well.
0," NAME, I'm pretty hungry right now. Want to walk over and check out the food table?"
0," NAME, do you know who that woman is over there by the window?"
0, That is NAME. I heard that she's just moved in with NAME.
0, I thought that he was with NAME.
0," Oh, that relationship is history. NAME hooked up with a guy she met on holiday."
-1, I bet that NAME wasn't too happy with that! 
0," Actually, he was OK with it. They hadn't been getting along too well."
0," Hi NAME, how are you?"
1," Things are going good, NAME. How about you?"
1, Things have been going well for me.
1, That food smells delicious! Let's wander over to the food table and see what's up.
0," NAME, do you know who that woman talking to NAME is?"
0, I think that her name is NAME. I think that she and NAME are moving in together.
0, Isn't he with NAME?
0, NAME dumped him. She ran off with a guy she met on vacation.
-1, NAME was probably less than thrilled with that! 
0, He was kind of relieved. They had been having some problems.
0, Is it true that you're looking for an apartment?
0, I am. How'd you know?
0, I heard it from one of our friends.
0," Well then, why do you ask if I'm looking for an apartment?"
0, I was thinking about leasing this apartment.
0, What does this have to do with me?
0, Would you like to sublease the apartment with me?
1, I would love to!
1," This way, we'll each have to pay only half the rent."
0, How much is the rent?
0," For each of us, it's $500 every month."
1, Sounds good to me.
1, Their wedding was absolutely beautiful.
1, It really was. I want a wedding like that.
0, How much do you think they spent on their wedding?
0, I think it might've cost them a nice chunk of change.
0, Do you want a big wedding like that?
0, Not really. I'd rather have a small wedding.
0, I wouldn't want a small wedding.
0, Why not?
1, I want my wedding to be big and memorable.
1, It can be small and memorable too.
0," Well, to each his own."
1, You are absolutely right.
1, Their wedding was just exquisite.
1, I know. Maybe one day I'll have a wedding like that.
0, What do you think their budget was?
0, It must have cost them a pretty penny.
0, Would you like to have a big wedding like they did?
0, No. I think I would prefer a smaller wedding.
1, I want a big wedding.
0, How come?
1," I want my wedding to be extravagant, and I want everyone to remember it."
0, Your wedding doesn't have to be big to be memorable.
0, Whatever floats your boat.
1, That is correct.
1, Their wedding was so beautiful.
1, I agree completely. I hope that I have a wedding like that one day.
0, How much do you reckon it cost to pull that wedding off?
0, I think it cost them a lot of money.
0, Do you hope to have a wedding as big as theirs?
0, I don't think so. I want to have a smaller wedding.
0, Not me.
0, Why do you want a bigger wedding?
1, I want to have a large wedding that everyone will remember.
1," You can have a small wedding, and people will still remember it."
0, Whatever flicks your Bic.
1, That is true.
0, Do you want to go to the beach tonight?
0," Sure, which beach are we going to?"
1, I wanted to go to Malibu beach.
1, I like NAME.
-1, The water there looks so dirty. 
1, I just like the pier they have at NAME.
1," I like the pier too, because it's beautiful at night."
0, Is Malibu beach nice?
1," It's a lot nicer, and I really like it better."
0, So you want to go to Malibu?
1, If that's okay with you.
1," Sure, let's go to Malibu."
0, What do you think about going to the beach tonight?
1, I'd love to. Which beach?
0," It's up to you, but I was thinking Malibu beach."
1, I really like NAME beach.
-1, But the water there doesn't look too clean. 
0, I only go because of the pier.
1, The pier is really nice at night.
0, How is it at Malibu beach?
1," I love Malibu beach, because it's so beautiful."
0, So is Malibu where you really want to go?
0, Are you cool with that?
0," Yeah, we can go to Malibu."
0, I want to go to the beach tonight.
1, That sounds like fun. Which one are you thinking about?
0," I was thinking Malibu, unless there is another beach you want to go to."
0, How about NAME?
-1," I don't really like that beach, as the water seems really dirty. "
0, The only thing I like about that beach is the pier.
1," At night, the pier is absolutely beautiful."
0, What's it like at Malibu beach?
1," I love that beach, because it's just so nice."
0, So we're going to Malibu?
0," Well, if you don't want to go to Malibu, we can go to NAME."
0, We can always go to NAME another day.
0, Are you ready for the business trip?
-1, Yeah. I'm a little nervous. 
0, Is this your first business trip?
0, No. I just don't know any of these people. Do you have any advice for me?
0, Just socialize. Get to know them. Go out for drinks one night.
0," Actually, two of our clients are taking me out for drinks the first night."
1, That's good. Don't stress about it so much.
1, I want to make a good first impression.
0, Then don't get drunk.
-1, What if I get nervous and drink too much. 
0, Then you'll have more things to worry about.
0, Hi NAME. What are you looking for?
0, Oh hi NAME. I'm looking for some materials to make a solar system.
0, A solar system?
0," Yeah, NAME has a science project. He has to make a model of the solar system with the sun and the planets."
0, How about some balls? They can represent the planets and the sun.
0," I was looking for some foam balls, but I can't find any in our garage."
0, I might have some. NAME had to make a solar system model a few years ago. I might have some balls left over.
1, That would be great! NAME wants to paint them and glue them on a black poster board.
0, That's what NAME did too.
0, Was NAME in Mrs. NAME's science class?
1, Yes!
0, She must have the students do the same project every year.
1, It's a great project. We had a fun time doing it together.
0," Are there eight or nine planets now? When I was a child, Pluto was a planet. But it's not considered a major planet anymore."
0, I know. I think scientists are still debating that issue. NAME should ask his teacher.
1, Good idea.
1, Let me go look for the balls. I think I still have her model in the garage too. I'll be right back.
1, Thank you! I'll keep looking in my garage too.
0, We go to the mountains every year.
0, Do you want to try something different this year?
0, Let's go somewhere warm.
0, Where should we go?
0, How about the beach? My co-worker owns a condo on the beach.
1, That sounds nice.
1, He said he would give us a discount on the cost.
1, We can celebrate our anniversary there.
1, That's a great idea!
0, We haven't been to the beach in a long time.
0, Hey NAME. Where are you going with all of that baseball gear?
0," Oh, hi NAME. I coach my son's baseball team. We're having our first practice today."
0, How old is your son?
0, 8 years old. He's been playing baseball for a couple of years.
0, Does he like it?
1, He loves it! This is my first year as a coach. I'm pretty excited.
1, It sounds exciting. I used to play baseball in college.
0, What position did you play?
-1, Pitcher. But I had to quit because of a shoulder injury. 
-1, That's too bad. Do you miss it? 
-1, Not anymore. I'm too old to play now. 
0, My son is a pitcher too. Maybe you can give him some tips on how to throw.
1, Sure. I'm always free in the afternoon.
0, We have our first game next Saturday. Would you like to come and watch?
1, That would be fun. What time is the game?
0, 10 am.
1, Ok. Can I bring my wife?
1, Of course.
0," Hello, I was just responding to your ad."
0, Which ad is that?
0, The ad for a roommate.
1, Great. Are you interested?
1, I sure am.
0, Can we meet today?
1," Of course, just tell me when and where."
1, Why don't you meet me at 5:30 at Starbucks?
1, That'll be perfect.
0, We'll discuss the living situation and payments at that time.
1, That'll be fine.
1," Okay, I'll see you then."
0, My son is taking his driver's license test today.
0, Is he nervous?
-1, He's a little nervous. 
0, It's normal to be nervous.
0," I told him that. He just wants to pass the test, so he can start driving to school."
0, Does he have a car?
0," No, he has to share with my wife."
0, Are you going to get him a car?
0," No, not yet. First, he has to show us that he is a responsible driver."
0, Did your auto insurance go up a lot?
-1, Yes! Our insurance rate doubled. 
-1, Wow! Are you serious? 
-1," Yes, that's what makes me nervous. I don't know how we'll be able to afford insurance when my younger son starts to drive. "
0, When will that be?
0, In two years.
0, Better start saving or better have your sons get part-time jobs.
0, I think I like the part-time job idea better.
0, Are you ready for the English test tomorrow?
-1, No. I am going to fail it. 
0, Didn't you study and take notes?
-1, My notes will not help me. 
0, Why?
-1, The teacher speaks too fast. I couldn't write anything down. 
0, Why didn't you ask her to speak slowly?
-1, I was too embarrassed to tell her I didn't understand. 
1, I'll help you study. I have a lot of notes.
0, We have a lot to do on this presentation.
0, I know. Should we divide the work?
1, That's a good idea. I'll outline what needs to be done.
1, Ok. I'll work on the presentation style.
1, Great!
1, We make a good team.
0, Can we go to the baseball game?
0, Of course.
1, I love baseball.
1, So do I.
1, I love to eat the peanuts.
1, I love to eat the hot dogs.
0, I hope we'll see a home run.
0, I hope we'll catch a foul ball.
0, Bring a jacket.
0, Yes. It gets a little cool at night.
0, Bring a glove to catch a foul ball.
0, No. I'll just use my cap to catch a foul ball.
-1, Golf is a silly game. 
-1, It certainly is. 
0, You hit a white ball.
0, And then you chase it.
0, And then you hit it again.
0," Finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground."
0," You do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes."
0, What's the point?
-1, How can it be fun? 
-1, They pay money to play this silly game! 
-1, I think golfers have a mental problem. 
-1, I think they are nuts. 
0, Do you want to go fishing?
1, Yes. That's a good idea.
0, Where do you want to go?
0, We can go to the river.
0, Or we can go to the lake.
0, Or we can go to the ocean.
1, Let's go to the lake.
1, Yes. The lake is only 10 miles away.
0, We can be there in 20 minutes.
1, I'll get our fishing rods.
1, I'll get the bait.
1, We'll have fresh fish for dinner!
1, Baseball is fun.
1, I like to hit the ball.
1, I like to run around the bases.
1, I like to slide into the bases.
1, Yeah. It's a lot of fun to slide.
1, I want to be a baseball player when I grow up.
1, Me too. I want to play for the Yankees.
1, Not me. I want to play for the Dodgers.
0, We have to practice every day.
-1, I don't like practice. 
-1, Me neither. It's boring. 
1, But practice makes perfect.
0, Let's go jogging.
1, That's a good idea.
0, I bought some new shoes.
0, Are they comfortable?
1, They're very comfortable.
0, How much were they?
0, They were on sale for $80.
0, Do they help you run faster?
1," No, but my feet don't hurt anymore."
1, Then they're worth every penny.
1, You might want to buy a pair.
0, I'll wait until I wear this pair out.
1, NAME is the greatest golfer in the world.
0, You can say that again.
-1, But I'm worried about NAME. 
0, Why is that?
0, Because he likes to SCUBA dive.
0, What's wrong with that?
-1, It can be dangerous. 
0, You mean he could drown.
0, He shouldn't SCUBA dive until he retires.
0, But he dives to relax.
-1," He might relax, but it makes me nervous. "
0," If his wife doesn't mind, you shouldn't mind."
0, Did you watch that golf tournament?
0, The one that NAME won?
0, How did he do it?
0, It was nothing for him.
1, He sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
1, He sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
0, I think he is from outer space.
1, No human could possibly play golf that well.
0," Whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot."
1, No human can do that.
0, Somebody should check his birth record.
1, I bet it says he was born on Mars.
0, This is NAME NAME in apartment 23. May I speak to the apartment manager?
0, Speaking. What can I do for you?
-1, Something happened to my window. It's broken. 
-1, That doesn't sound good. Do you know how it happened? 
-1, I don't know the exact details. 
0, Do you have an idea who might be responsible for the window?
0, I'm almost sure it is the local kids in the apartments.
0, How did you come to that conclusion?
0, There was a baseball in my living room along with the broken glass.
0," Well, at least there's no mystery about how it happened."
0, I saw a group of them playing in the lot just before I went out to my car.
0, Can you tell me which ones you recognized?
-1, I just looked at them for a second. 
0," I'll call a repairman, but it might take two days."
0, How about if I call a friend of mine who is a repairman?
1, That's no problem. I'll come by right now to look at the damage.
0," Okay. Come on over. But tell me, who pays for this?"
-1," You can pay for it, and I can reimburse you. Or he can bill me directly. "
1, I'm glad to hear that. I didn't want to get stuck with the bill.
-1, I will bill the kid's parents if I ever find out which kid did it. 
0," Hi, I'm calling about your ad."
0, Which ad are you calling about?
0, The ad for a new roommate.
0, Are you interested in being my new roommate?
1," Yes, I'm interested."
1," I would love to meet you, if that's at all possible."
1," That's fine, where would you like to meet?"
1, I would like you to meet me at Starbucks at 5:30.
0, I can meet you then.
0, We'll talk about the roommate situation then.
1, Thank you very much.
1, See you later.
0, Who is the greatest baseball player?
1, There are so many great players.
0," Yes, but who is the greatest?"
1, I would have to say NAME NAME.
0, Most people would say that.
1, He changed the game.
1," Yes, he made the home run popular."
1," Everybody loved him, all over the nation."
1, He helped make the Yankees the best team ever.
1," And NAME was a good person, too."
1, He always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
1, There will never be another NAME.
0, Did you hear what happened at the baseball game?
0," No, please tell me."
0, Someone punched out someone.
-1, That's not nice. 
-1, It's worse than that. 
0, How so?
-1, Two guys got into an argument. 
0, I'll bet they were drinking.
0, A third guy punched one of the two guys.
0," I'll bet he was drinking, too."
-1, The victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died. 
-1, That is terrible. Can't people just have fun at a baseball game? 
0, I want to go to the ball game.
0, Is there a game tonight?
0," Yes, it starts at 7 p.m."
0, Can we get tickets?
0," Yes, but only the cheap tickets."
0, How much are they?
1, They are only $5 each.
1, That is a good price.
1," Yes, it is cheaper than a hot dog or a beer."
0, Where are the seats?
0, They're behind the outfield.
1, Maybe we can catch a home run ball.
-1, Golf is so hard. 
0, What's so hard about hitting a little white ball?
0, It's hard if you want to do it right.
0, You mean like NAME?
0," No, like a good amateur golfer."
0, What's so hard about golf?
0, There are so many things you have to do right.
0, Like what?
0," Like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through."
-1, Yikes! Who can remember all that? 
0, You need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.
-1, Forget it. Golf sounds more like work than fun. 
0, Did you hear about the ball player?
0, The home run hitter on drugs?
0, He said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
0, He said he wasn't using drugs.
0, He apologized to the fans.
0, The league suspended him for 50 games.
0, That will cost him some money.
0," Yes, about $7 million."
0, That will teach him a good lesson.
0, He probably won't use drugs anymore.
0, Hey NAME. What are you doing for Spring Break?
0," I'm going to Florida with some friends. Do you want to join us, NAME?"
1, Sure! That sounds like fun. I need to ask my parents first.
0, Ok. Let me know later. We're going to leave on Friday at 3 pm.
0, Where are we going to stay?
0, My parents own a beach house. They said I could invite a few friends.
1, That's nice! How many people are going?
0, I'm inviting four people including you.
0, Are your parents going to be there?
0, Yeah. They want to be there just in case there is an emergency.
0, What should I bring?
0," Clothes, swimsuit, and a surfboard."
0, I don't have a surfboard.
0, I think you can rent one at the beach. Do you know how to surf?
0, Yeah. I've done it a few times.
1, Cool.
1, Let me call my parents. I'll text you later.
1, Ok. It's going to be fun.
0, Hi NAME. What are you doing today?
0, Hi NAME. Today we are doing our annual spring cleaning.
0, What is that?
0," It's the day we thoroughly clean the whole house. We throw away things we don't need, pack up things to donate, clean all of the rooms, and wash all of the windows."
0, Wow! That's a lot to do.
0, Yeah. It takes all day.
0, Do your kids help too.
0, Of course. They look through their closets and toy bins to find clothes and toys to donate or throw away.
1, That's a great idea! But why is it called spring cleaning?
0, Because it's done in the spring season.
0, I see. I think we're going to start doing this too. Our house is so cluttered.
0," After we have the things ready for donation, NAME takes them to the local homeless shelter. This makes the house easier to clean."
1, That's great! I'm going to tell my family about this.
0," Well, I better get started. I have a lot to do. Talk to you later, NAME."
1," Bye, NAME. Thanks for the cleaning tip."
0, Why are the police here?
-1, NAME is being arrested. 
0, Why?

0, What did she steal?
0, Money. A lot of money.
0, How much?
0, Over a million dollars.
-1, Wow! NAME is the vice-president of the company. 
-1, This scandal is going to make the news. 
0, I don't know what I'm going to do.
0, What's wrong?
-1, The stock market crashed. 
0, Did you have investments?
-1, Yes. I lost all my money. 
-1, I'm too scared to invest my money. 
-1," Mommy, I don't feel very well. "
0," What's wrong, NAME? Didn't you have a good time at the birthday party?"
-1, Yeah. It was a lot of fun. But now my tummy hurts. 
0, Did you eat too much food at the party?
0, I think so.
0, What did you eat?
0," Pizza, cake, ice cream, and potato chips."
0, That is a lot of food.
0," I also had soda, cookies, and popcorn."
-1," NAME, that's why your stomach hurts. You ate too much. Why did you eat so much? "
1, Everything looked delicious.
0," NAME, I think you should go lie down for a while?"
0," Ok, mommy."
0," NAME, where are you going?"
0, I need to go to the bathroom first.
1," Hey, I was wondering about the ad you have."
0, What ad are you referring to?
0, I'm calling about the ad for a new roommate.
1," Oh, yeah. Were you interested in being a roommate of mine?"
1, I actually would like to be your new roommate.
1, That's great. Would you like to meet me sometime today?
0," Tell me where, and I'll be there."
1, Let's meet at Starbucks at 5:30.
1, Starbucks at 5:30 will be fine.
1, I'll fill you in on all the details when we get together.
1," All right, that sounds great."
1, I'll see you at Starbucks.
-1, I can't believe people like this show. 
-1, Stop complaining. It's not that bad. 
0, Is there anything else to watch?
1, I like this show. Give it a chance.
-1, There is just too much singing. 
0, It's a musical. There's supposed to be singing.
0, How can you watch this?
-1, I like musicals. Are you going to continue complaining? 
-1," No. I'll stop, but I get to choose the show next time. "
-1," Ok. That's a deal. Now, stop complaining. "
0, Let's stretch our brand.
0, What do you mean?
1," Our clothes are popular, so let's make shoes too."
0, Do you mean have a clothing and shoe line under the same brand name?
1, Yes! I know a shoe designer who wants to work with us.
1, Ok! Let's get started on it.
-1, I'm stuck in traffic again. 
0, Why? Is there an accident?
0, I don't know. I don't see anything.
0, Should I cancel our dinner reservations?
0, No. Can you try to change it for a later time?
0, I will call the restaurant and ask them.
1, Ok. The cars are moving again.
-1, Don't drive while talking on your cell phone. It's dangerous. 
1, Ok. I will see you soon.
1, Drive safely.
0," NAME, I'm going to the supermarket this afternoon. Do you need anything?"
0, Yes Mom. Can you buy some snacks for school?
0, Sure. What kind of snacks?
1, I like pretzels and potato chips.
1, Ok. I will pick up some fruits too.
-1, I don't like fruits. 
1, Fruits are healthy for you.
0, Can I go to the market with you?
0, Are you done with your homework?
-1, No. I have to study for a math test tomorrow. 
0, Then you should stay home and study.
-1, I need to take break. I've been studying all day. 
0, Ok. We will only be gone for about an hour.
0, Can we get ice cream on the way home?
0, I thought you needed to study.
1, I've studied enough. I'm ready for my math test.
0, Hi NAME. Where are you going?
0, Hi NAME. I'm heading to the market.
0, Which one?
0, The one down the street.
1, Today is a good day to go. There are a lot of items on sale.
1, That's great to know. I need to buy a lot of stuff.
0, The market is going out of business?
0, Why?
0, Not enough customers.
-1, That's not good. I always go to that market. 
-1, Me too. But more people are going to the bigger market a few blocks away. 
-1, It's always so crowded there. 
0, I know. But it has a bigger selection of things.
1," Yeah, but I still like the smaller store."
1," Well, you better leave soon. There were a lot of people today because of the big sale."
1, Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I'll see you later.
0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is NAME.
0, Hi NAME. What's up?
0, I want to throw Mom a surprise birthday party.
1, That's wonderful idea. How can I help?
0, Do you know who we should invite?
0, Her friends and co-workers?
0, Do you have their phone numbers or e-mail addresses?
0," No, I don't. Why don't we ask Dad? He should have them."
0, Do you think Dad can keep a secret?
1, Yeah. Remember he surprised her with a trip to France a couple of years ago?
1, Oh yeah. Mom was so surprised.
0, What kind of food should we serve?
1," Let's serve Mom's favorite food, pasta. I can cook."
1, Ok. I can take care of the party decorations.
1, Perfect. Should we get together to discuss all of the plans?
0, Sure. Do you want to meet right now?
0, No. I have some things to do. Can I meet you at 5 pm?
1, Ok. That sounds good.
1, Why don't you come to my house? I can make us dinner.
0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is Mom. Are you and NAME free on Friday night?
0, We're having dinner with friends. Why? What's going on?
1, Your dad's co-workers are throwing him a surprise retirement party.
1, Really? That's so nice of them.
0, I know. I was hoping you and NAME could attend.
1, Of course we will. I'll reschedule the dinner party.
1," That would be wonderful. But remember it's a surprise. So, don't tell him."
0, I won't. Is Dad sad about retiring?
0, No. He is actually looking forward to it. He has worked a long time.
0, Yeah. I remember all of those long hours he worked.
1, He was a great employee. They're going to miss him at the office.
0, What are you and Dad going to do now?
0, I think we're going to take a trip to Hawaii.
1, That's good! It's a great place to relax.
0, It sure is. We even talked about retiring there.
1, Really? That would be awesome!
1, You and your family could vacation in Hawaii. You'll have a free place to stay.
-1," Mom, that sounds awesome. But I'll miss you both. "
1, It is ok.
0, Are you going to the hospitality event?
0, Yes. I have a few clients attending.
1, Great! This year we're doing a raffle and gift bags.
0, Raffle and gift bags? Isn't that a little childish?
0, The raffle prize is a sports car and the gift bags are filled with jewelry.
0, Are you serious? Can our company afford this?
1, The CEO wants to keep our clients happy.
1, That's definitely going to keep them happy.
1, It'll probably attract more clients to our company too.
0, I need some tips on negotiating.
1, Ok. Don't be in a hurry to end negotiations.
-1, Why? I hate negotiating. I want it to be over quickly. 
0," If you're in a rush, you're more likely to make mistakes."
-1, That's true. I made a bad deal once because I was in a hurry. 
0," If you show them patience, they will think you are not under pressure to make a quick deal. They will start to give you what you want because they think you don't need their offer."
1, That's also true. This is great advice.
0," Just take your time. There's a lot of money involved, so you don't want to make any mistakes in your negotiations."
1, Thank you! These are great negotiating tips!
0, Where should we go this summer?
0, Let's take a cruise.
-1, I'm afraid of the ocean. 
0, Why?
0, What if the ship sinks?
-1, You shouldn't say that. That's bad luck. 
-1," Also, there are sharks in the ocean. "
-1, You won't be swimming in the ocean. 
0," If the ship sinks, we will."
-1, You are being silly. Let's just stay in a hotel with a pool. 
1, I finally found an apartment that I want to rent.
0, Where did you see it?
0, I saw it in this ad for apartments in today's newspaper.
0, You found an apartment in the ads?
1," I really did, but what's so great about it is that it's really affordable."
0, Tell me about the apartment.
1," Well, most importantly the apartment is beautiful."
0, How much is the rent for the apartment?
0, The rent is $725 each month.
1, That's pretty cheap for out here.
1, That's what I said when I found out how much the rent was.
1, Congratulations on the new apartment.
-1, I'm going to be late this morning. 
0, Is there something wrong?
-1, My dog is sick. 
-1, I'm sorry to hear that. 
0, I have to take him to the vet.
0, I'll let our team know.
1, Thanks.
0," If it's serious, take the whole day off."
1, Thank you for understanding.
1, I have two dogs. They're the best.
0, Is NAME in his office?
0, No. He's in a meeting.
0, I need to talk to him about my start time. I need to start an hour later.
0, Why?
0, NAME is going back to work and I need to be home until my son leaves for school.
1," I'm sure NAME will be fine with that. He's a single dad, so he will understand."
1," You take such good care of your plants, NAME."
1, I try my best. I love plants.
-1, I have killed every plant I have ever owned. 
0," How, NAME?"
-1," I don't know. I water them and make sure they get enough sun, but they still die. "
0, That's strange.
-1, I know. I don't buy plants anymore. 
1, That's sad. Plants are beautiful and they provide oxygen too.
0, Can you teach me how to care for plants?
0, Sure. I'm going on vacation tomorrow. I'll be gone for a couple of weeks. We can start after I get back.
1, Ok! Can we shop for the plants together?
1, Yes. Let's get a couple of plants that require low maintenance.
0, What do you mean by low maintenance?
0, Plants that don't need much attention.
1, That will be perfect for me.
1, I'll make a list of good plants for you.
0, What are you going to do about all of your plants while you're on vacation?
0," Well, I was going to ask you to water them for me, but I think I'll ask my sister instead."
1," Yeah, that's a good idea."
0, I have to leave work early today.
0, We're not done with the project.
-1, But I have tickets to a game. 
-1, You haven't done your share of the work. 
0, I'll do it tomorrow.
-1, The project is due tomorrow. 
0, Could you pick our client up from the airport?
0, Sure. What time is his flight?
0, 5PM.
-1, 5 PM? That's rush hour. 
-1, I know. I'm sorry about that. 
0, Where do I drop him off?
0, His hotel is downtown.
-1, Downtown? I need to come back downtown during rush hour? 
0," Yes, please. Would you also be able to take him out to dinner?"
-1, Dinner too? 
0, Yes. You can borrow the company car.
-1, I can't understand why everyone is so mad at NAME. 
-1, He was rude to NAME. 
0, I don't think he was rude.
-1, He said mean things to NAME. 
0, NAME asked NAME a question.
-1, NAME didn't have to be so honest. 
0, NAME was just telling the truth.
-1, Sometimes the truth is painful. 
-1, Then you shouldn't ask questions. 
-1, I can't understand why you are on NAME's side. 
0, Can you take the kids to school today?
0, Sure.
0, The plumber is coming at 8 AM. I need to be home.
0, Ok. Do I drop NAME off first?
0," Yes. When you drop NAME off, you have to walk her to her classroom."
0, Why?
0, Because she is in kindergarten and the school does not allow them to be dropped off in the parking lot.
1, That's right. I forgot.
0, Looks like you need to drop the kids off at school more often.
0, I think they need to take the bus to school.
-1, Why is this elevator so slow? 
0, How long have you been waiting?
0, 10 minutes.
-1, This is a very old building. 
-1, I don't have time to wait. I'm going to take the stairs. 
-1, We're on the 18th floor! 
-1, I don't care. I'm going to be late for work. 
0, I'll come with you.
-1," Ok, but you're wearing high heels. "
0, Fine. I'll wait for the elevator.
1, Good luck.
0, How was the concert?
1, It was great! The band was amazing!
0, Was it better than the last concert that you went to?
1, I don't know. Both were great.
-1, I wish I wasn't sick. I'm sad I missed it. 
1, Let's go together next time.
0, Hey NAME. Did you get your report card?
0, Hey NAME. Yeah.
0, How did you do in Math?
1, I did well. How about you?
-1, I didn't do too well. I failed the class. 
0, How? What happened?
-1, I think I failed the final exam. 
-1, I'm sorry to hear that. What are you going to do? 
-1, I have to take the class again during the summer or I can't graduate. 
-1, Are you serious? That's terrible. 
-1," I was supposed to go on a vacation with my older brother. We were going to go to Europe, but now I won't be able to. "
1, I don't have any plans for the summer. I can help you if you need it.
1, Thanks. That would be nice.
0, Do you know when summer school starts?
0, I think it starts at the end of June.
0, That's right after regular school ends.
-1," I know. I won't have much time to enjoy my summer, but I need to graduate. "
1, Don't worry. I'll help you.
0, I found an apartment to rent.
0, Where did you find this apartment?
0, I found it in today's apartment ads.
1, Really? I can't believe you actually found an apartment in the ads.
1," I actually found it in the ads, and it's not too expensive either."
1, I want to hear more about this apartment.
1, All you really need to know is that the apartment looks great.
0, How much will you have to pay for rent?
1, Every month I'd only have to pay $725.
1," For where we live, that is really inexpensive."
1," It is, isn't it?"
1, I'm glad to hear that you finally found an apartment.
0," NAME, I'm picking you up from school early today."
0, Why Mom?
0, You have a dentist appointment.
-1, I don't want to go. 
0, It's just a check-up.
-1, But it hurt last time. 
0, That is because you had a cavity.
-1, But I brush my teeth every day. 
-1," I know, but you eat too much candy. "
-1, I hope I don't have any cavities this time. 
0, Me too.
0, What time are you picking me up?
0, 2 o'clock.
0, Ok. I'll tell my teacher.
0, I will also call the school office.
1, Ok. I'll see you later.
0, Hey NAME! Did you see the fish NAME just caught?
0, No. What did he catch? How big was it?
1, A 20 pound salmon!
-1, Wow! I've been here all day and have caught nothing! Have you caught anything? 
0," Yeah, just a couple of small trout."
-1, That's better than me. I just want to give up and go home. 
0, Don't give up. You might catch something soon.
0, My wife told me to bring home dinner.
0, Fish?
0, Yeah. I may have to go to the market and buy one.
-1, That's silly. Just wait. 
-1, The sun is starting to set and I'm tired of being out here. 
1, At least it didn't rain today. We had clear skies all day.
1," That's true. It was nice today. Hey, can you hold my fishing pole? I need to go to the restroom."
1," Sure. Wait, NAME!"
0," NAME, what?"
1," Something is pulling on your fishing pole! Here, grab it!"
1, Wow! That's a huge salmon!
1, I told you to be patient and you would catch something.
1, Now I can take home dinner. Want to come over and have salmon with us?
0, Hi NAME. What are you doing?
1, Hi NAME. I got a new cell phone. I'm reading the manual.
1, That's a nice phone.
1, Thanks. I really like it.
-1, I need to get a new one too. My phone is old. 
0, Would you like to look at my phone?
1, That would be great.
0, Be careful with it.
1, Don't worry. I will.
1, It is very light. It has a lot of functions.
1, I like your phone. How much did it cost?
0, It was expensive. It was $100.
0, Wow! That's too much for me. I think I will wait for a sale.
1, This was a gift from my parents. It was my birthday yesterday.
1," Oh, happy birthday!"
1, Thanks!
1, Let's get some ice cream to celebrate.
1, Ok. I'm tired of reading this manual. I need a break.
0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is NAME. Have you completed the class project?
0, Yeah. I finished it last night. How about you?
-1," No, not yet. I'm having a hard time with the conclusion of my report. "
0, Do you need any help?
0, Maybe just a little. Do you have time tonight?
-1, No. I'm sorry. It's my aunt and uncle's anniversary and I promised to babysit my niece. 
0, Oh. I understand.
0, I'm free tomorrow night.
1, Tomorrow is good for me too. Can I come over or would you like to come here.
-1, It might be quieter at your house. My brother is going to have a friend over and they can be very noisy. 
1, Ok. Then let's meet at my house.
1, Sounds good. What time should I come over?
1, How about 5 pm? I can make you dinner.
1, Really? I'd love to come for dinner.
0, What's your favorite dish?
1, Spaghetti and meatballs. But please make anything you like.
1, Spaghetti and meatballs are my specialty. I'll make that.
1, Sounds great! I will be there tomorrow at 5 pm.
1, See you tomorrow night.
-1, Hi NAME. Why do you look so tired? 
0, Oh hi NAME. We just got back from the emergency room.
0, Why? What happened?
-1, NAME had to get stitches. 
-1, Why? Did he cut himself? 
-1," Yeah, he was slicing some onions and the knife slipped. He got a really deep cut on his finger. "
-1, That sounds painful. 
-1, The painful part was waiting at the emergency room. There was only one doctor working tonight. We waited three hours. 
0, What about his finger?
0, The nurse wrapped it with a bandage to stop the bleeding.
-1, I hate the ER. It is always crowded and takes too long. 
-1," I know. But, I knew he had to have stitches. It was a really bad cut, so we had to stay. "
0, How many stitches did he get?
-1, Nine. He won't be able to play video games for a few weeks. 
0, Is that a good thing?
-1," Actually, it is. But he's not happy about it. "
0, Where do you work?
0, I work for a law firm.
0, What do you do there?
0," I answer phones, file papers, and create spreadsheets."
0, What are spreadsheets?
0, Spreadsheets are documents created on a computer that contain all kinds of data in rows and columns.
0, It sounds complicated.
1, Not really. It's pretty easy. The computer does all the calculations for you.
0, Do you like your job?
1," The job is ok. But, my bosses are great."
0," Hey NAME, what did your mom pack for your lunch today?"
0," Hey NAME. She packs me the same lunch every day. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cookies, and milk."
-1, I got something new today. It looks like a tuna sandwich. I'm not sure I like it. 
1, I love tuna sandwiches. Do you want to trade?
1, Sure! But will your mom get mad?
0, No. She won't know. I won't tell her.
0, Do you ever buy the school lunch?
-1," No, it looks gross. "
1, It's actually not bad. Some dishes are pretty good.
0, Which ones have you tried?
-1, The spaghetti and pizza are good. But the hamburgers and burritos are terrible. They taste like cardboard. 
-1, That's awful! Maybe I'll buy lunch when the cafeteria serves spaghetti and pizza. Those are my favorite dishes at home. 
1," They're pretty good, but not as good as our moms' cooking."
0, Are you done with lunch? Let's go out to recess.
1, Yeah. Let's go!
0, Hey NAME! Is that your new car?
1, Yeah! I just got it yesterday.
1, That's nice! I love the color.
1, Me too. NAME is my favorite color.
0, How do you like it?
1, I love it. It has great gas mileage and it has lot of cool features.
0, What is your favorite feature?
1, The sunroof.
0, Did you get a good deal?
1," Yeah. My cousin is a car salesman, so he helped me out."
0, I need to buy a new car soon. Do you think your cousin could help me too?
1," Of course, that's his job. And, he would love the commission."
0, Where does he work?
1, Downtown. I can go with you when you're ready to buy a car.
0, I need to save a little more money first. It's a big purchase.
0, I know. I don't think I can go out to dinner for a while.
0," Yeah, it's expensive to eat out all the time."
0, I better learn how to cook.
-1, I'm not happy with my room. 
0, May I ask what is wrong?
-1, I asked for a room with a view. But this room has no view. 
-1," I'm sorry, but we do not have any more rooms available tonight. "
-1," When I made the reservation, I paid for a room with a view. "
-1," I understand. I'm very sorry, but all of the rooms are occupied. "
-1, This is unacceptable. 
0, We will discount your room rate.
-1, Our company does a lot of business with this hotel. I will be telling my boss about this. 
-1, May we offer you a free stay next time? It will be a room with a view. I will guarantee it. 
0, Is that the CEO of the company?
0, Yes. He's talking to the vice-president of the company.
0, I'm going to go introduce myself.
-1, Are you crazy? They won't know you. 
0, That's why I'm going to introduce myself.
1, Good luck.
0, I want to be a manager one day. This is one way to move up the ladder.
0, Ok. Let me know how the conversation goes.
0, Why don't you come with me?
-1," No, thanks. I'm too nervous. "
1, I think I may rent out this apartment that I found.
0," Oh, really? Where did you find it?"
0," I was looking through the ads today, and I found it in there."
0, In the ads? Are you serious?
1," Yeah, and it's affordable too."
1, I'd like to hear about this apartment.
1," First of all, it's absolutely gorgeous."
0, What is the rent each month?
1, It's only $725 a month.
1, That's amazing. The rent is very cheap.
1, I know it is.
1, It's a good thing that you read that ad today.
0, Can we share this cab?
0, Where are you going?
0, To 5th Avenue and Main Street.
1, That's where I'm going too.
1, Great! It's so hard to catch a cab at this time.
0, I know! Are you going to work?
0," No, I'm meeting some friends at a restaurant."
0, Is it the new Thai place?
0, Yes. Have you been there?
0, Yeah.
0, How is it?
1, It's pretty good.
1, Oh good. It's my first time trying Thai food.
1, Really? Everything is freshly made.
1, That's good to hear. I'm a little picky about food.
1, I hope you like it.
1, Thanks. Where are you going?
0, Work.
0, Where do you work?
0, I'm a chef at the new Thai restaurant.
1, That's awesome!
1," Let the chef know what you think later. If you liked it, you may get a free dessert."
1, You're funny!
-1, Why are you always late? 
-1, I'm sorry. 
-1, You are always sorry. 
0, What can I say?
-1, What is your excuse this time? 
-1, I didn't hear my alarm clock. 
-1, We are meeting for lunch not breakfast. 
-1, I went to sleep very late. 
0, Were you studying for a test?
0, No. I was at a party last night.
-1, You have terrible excuses for being late. 
0," Hi. I'm NAME, the Customer Service manager."
0," Hi NAME. I'm NAME, the manager of the IT department."
1, Nice to meet you NAME. I think I spoke with you on the phone last week.
1, You're right. There was an issue with your computer.
1," Yes, that was it. Thanks for fixing the problem quickly."
1, No problem. You can call my office any time if you have any technical issues.
0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is Mom.
0, Hi Mom. How are you doing?
1," Oh, I'm fine. I'm just planning the menu for the Thanksgiving dinner."
0, What can I help you with this year?
1, Would you like to bring your delicious pumpkin pies again? Everyone loved them last year.
0, Sure. Is there anything else?
0," No, I think your sisters are bringing salads and other side dishes."
0, Ok. Will our cousins be joining us?
0, I don't think so. I think they have to go to visit their In-laws this year.
0, Ok. How many pumpkin pies should I bring?
0, Maybe three? That should be plenty.
0, Ok. Are you roasting a big turkey this year?
0," Yeah, probably around 20 pounds."
1, Wow! That's big.
1, I like having leftovers. I make turkey sandwiches and soups for your Dad.
-1, Mom. I have a confession. 
0, What is it? Is it serious?
-1, I don't make my pumpkin pies. I buy them at the market. 
0," Oh, I know. The price tags were on the bottom of the pans."
0, Hi NAME. Why aren't you packing? Aren't you going home for Thanksgiving?
-1," Hey NAME. No, the airplane ticket is too expensive. "
-1," Oh, that's too bad. What are you going to do for Thanksgiving then? "
0, I'm just going to spend it here in the dormitory.
-1, But the college campus will be closed and most of our friends will be going home for the weekend. 
0, I know. I'll just use the time to study.
-1, That's not fun. Would you like to come over to my house this weekend? 
-1," No, that's ok. I don't want to be a burden. "
1, Don't be silly. You won't be a burden. My mom always makes too much food. All of relatives come over. We have a great time.
1, Are you sure? I would really like that.
1, Of course I'm sure. We have plenty of room too.
1, Thanks. You're a great friend.
1," You're welcome! Now, you better start packing. I'm leaving soon."
0, What time are we leaving?
0, 3 o'clock. It's a three hour drive from here.
1, Ok. Let me pay for gas.
1, We can each pay half.
1, Sounds great! Thanks again. I'll be ready soon.
-1, I think this client is trying to avoid me. 
0, Why?
-1, I've left him several messages and he is not returning my calls. 
0, Why do you need to contact him?
-1, He hasn't paid a single bill. 
0, That's why he's not returning your calls.
0," Hello, can I help you?"
1, I'd like to order your daily special.
0, Ok. Would you like it spicy or non-spicy?
0, I guess non-spicy. I've never been asked that before.
0, Would you like white rice or fried rice?
0, NAME? Is this NAME's Pizza Place?
0," No, this is a Chinese restaurant."
0, I thought I was ordering pizza.
0," No, our daily special is Mongolian beef with rice."
1, That sounds good. I'll take one order to go with white rice.
0, Have you seen NAME?
-1, Don't go in his office right now. 
0, Why?
-1, He's in a bad mood. 
0, Why is he such a grump in the morning?
0, Maybe he needs more coffee.
0, I would like to make a haircut appointment with NAME.
0, NAME does not work here anymore.
1, When did NAME leave? She was a great hair stylist.
0, She moved out of the state last month.
0, Is there anyone else you recommend?
1, NAME is a great stylist.
1, OK. I will try her.
0, She has an opening tomorrow at 4 PM.
1, I will take it.
1, You will love NAME.
0, Guess what I heard about NAME.
-1, She's getting a divorce. 
0, How did you know that?
0, NAME told me.
0, NAME told me too.
-1, NAME is a gossip queen. 
1," Hello, how are you doing today?"
1, I'm great.
1, What can I do for you today?
1, I wanted to ask about the apartment for rent.
0, Ask away.
0, I was wondering if the apartment is located in a nice area.
1," As a matter of fact, the apartment is in a wonderful location."
0, What surrounds the apartment?
1, There are many stores and restaurants surrounding the apartment.
0, Is that right?
1, I promise you that you will love the location.
1," From what you're telling me, it sounds like I will."
0, Do you remember when we were kids?
-1, Yes. You were mean to me. 
-1," No, I wasn't. "
-1," Yes, you were. You used to take my toys. "
-1, I did? I'm sorry. 
1, That's ok. You're a great brother now.
0, Is that a rowing machine?
0, Yeah. I don't know why I bought it.
0, Are you trying to work out?
0, That was the plan.
0, How's it going?
-1, I wasted my money. 
0, Did you see NAME's face?
1, Yes. She looked very surprised.
-1, She is faking it. 
0, What do you mean?
0, She knew about the surprise party.
0, How do you know?
0, NAME accidentally told her about it.
1, Are you sure? She looked really surprised to me.
1, She's a great actress.
0, I guess you can't believe everything you see.
0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is NAME. Are you free tonight?
0, I have to work.
0, What time do you get off work?
0, 7 pm. Why?
0, I have tickets to the symphony. Would you like to go?
0, What time does it start?
0, 7 pm. Can you get off work a little early?
-1," No, I'm the only one available tonight. "
0, You can come late. I can drop off the ticket at your work.
-1, I might be really late. I have to go home first to shower and change my clothes. Then I have to drive all the way to the concert hall. 
0, Oh. Maybe I should ask someone else this time.
-1," Yeah, that might be a better idea. I'm sorry. "
-1, We need a new sink. This one is leaking again. 
0, I'll call a plumber.
-1, Can we just buy a new sink? 
0, Why?
-1, This one is so old. 
1, It's in good condition.
-1," No, it is not. It is leaking again. "
0, We just need to fix the leak.
-1, We've fixed it three times already. 
0, You're right. We need a new sink.
0, My watch always gains ten minutes a day.
0, That's funny. My watch always loses ten minutes a day.
0, No kidding.
-1," I'm serious. Every morning I set my watch by the radio, but it still loses ten minutes. "
0, You know what you can do?
0, Throw it away and buy a new one?
0," No, you don't have to. You only need to put your watch back ten minutes everyday."
0, So you put your watch back ten minutes everyday?
0," Yeah, that's what I'm doing."
1, Why bother? Just buy a new watch. It doesn't cost much.
0," Hey, you have so many clocks in your bedroom."
0," Yeah, I want to make sure I can wake up in the morning."
0, But is there something wrong with your clocks? None of them has the same time.
0," I do it on purpose. I set this clock ahead ten minutes, and this one back ten minutes, but I always set that one to the right time."
0, So the alarms ring every ten minutes?
0, Yeah.
0, Are your crazy or what?
0," No, I am a heavy sleeper. I need thunder to wake me up."
-1," Sorry, I overslept. My clock didn't go off this morning. "
-1, Again? 
-1," That's right, even though I did set the alarm last night. "
-1, Your clock never works. Perhaps you should buy a new one. 
0," Well, if it breaks down again tomorrow, I'll definitely buy a new one."
-1, Maybe by then it'll be too late. 
-1, What do you mean too late? 
-1, By that time you'll be fired. 
-1," Ha, NAME, you're late. "
-1," Yeah. Each time we switch to daylight savings time, I always forget to put the clock forward an hour. "
0," Well, then later this year when we switch back to normal time, don't forget to set the clock back one hour."
-1," I just can't win! Each time we switch back to normal time, I always forget to put the clock back an hour, so I always come to work an hour early. "
0," So, just remember. Spring forward, fall back."
0," So, that'll make it even."
-1, I am getting tired of taking the stairs. 
0, Why are you taking the stairs?
-1, My apartment elevator isn't working. 
0, How long has it been broken?
0, Two weeks.
-1, You live on the 8th floor! 
0, How are you?
1," Good, thank you."
0, What can I help you with?
0, Can I ask you a few questions about the apartment?
1, Ask whatever you'd like.
0, I want to know if the location of the apartment is nice.
1, I honestly believe that you will love the location.
0, What kinds of places are around the apartment?
1, Surrounding the apartment are great places to eat and stores to shop at.
0," Oh, really?"
1, I'm sure that the location will be to your liking.
1, I hope that you're right.
0, What are you going to order?
0, I'm going to have a burger.
0, I'm not really hungry. I'm just going to have a salad.
0, You might get hungry later.
0, Then I'll order something to go too.
1, That's a good idea. You always get hungry around midnight.
0," What's wrong, NAME."
0, Hey NAME. My family and I planned a trip to Hawaii and I'm not sure I can go now.
0, Why?
-1, I'm so busy at work. I have too many things to do. 
0, What do you have to do?
0, I have a big presentation due soon.
0, What are you going to do?
-1, I don't know. The airline tickets are non-refundable and my family is going to be very sad. 
0, Is there any way you can finish everything before your trip?
-1," That's what I'm trying to do, but I don't know if I can. "
0, Is there anyone at work who can help you?
-1," Yeah, but he's been sick. "
-1, Oh. That's terrible. Why don't you talk to your boss? 
-1, He's not very understanding. He just wants the work to be completed. 
0, Maybe you can take work with you on your trip.
-1, That's not a vacation. But I may have to do that. My wife is not going to be happy. 
0, I wish I could help you.
1, Thanks. Do you know anything about presentations?
0," No, I'm an accountant."
-1, Why are you late again? 
-1, I'm sorry. There was a lot of traffic. 
-1, That's always your excuse. 
-1, I know. I left too late. 
0, Then you should leave earlier.
0, I'll try next time.
0, Why didn't you show up for class this morning?
-1, I don't even want to talk about it. My car broke down. 
0, What happened?
-1, The engine seems to be busted. It's driving me crazy! 
0, Wow. Have you thought about getting a new car?
-1," Yeah, I've thought about that, but I can't afford a new car. I'm broke. "
0, Maybe you can lease a car. It doesn't cost much. I know Toyota is running a promotion.
0, Really? How much is it?
0, Zero down and $219 per month.
1, That's a good deal. I might wanna consider it.
-1, My car wouldn't start this morning. 
0, I used to have a problem like that. Did you check the battery?
-1, Yeah. It was dead again. I had to find someone to jump it for me. It's driving me crazy. 
0," Well, maybe you should buy a new battery."
-1, But I just bought this one three months ago. It's still new! 
0, Maybe they were dishonest and gave you an old one.
-1," Well, I don't know. Whatever it is, I'm going to return it. It's ridiculous! "
0," Hi, NAME, I heard you just bought a car."
-1," Yeah. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a piece of junk. "
0, What do you mean?
-1," I bought the car for five thousand dollars, but it just doesn't run. "
0, Then why did you buy it?
1, It worked perfectly when I bought it.
-1," Hm, I think you were ripped off. "
-1, You didn't show up for dinner last night. NAME was a little upset. 
-1, I know. I'm awfully sorry. 
0, Why didn't you let him know you weren't coming?
-1, I couldn't help it. My girlfriend had an accident and was taken to the hospital. 
-1," Oh, that's terrible. Is she OK? "
-1," She wasn't hurt badly, but she was shaken up. "
0," Sir, did I do anything wrong?"
0," Yes, sir. You ran through the stop sign. May I see your driver license, please?"
-1," Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see the stop sign at the corner. I didn't mean it. "
0," That doesn't justify your violation. May I see your license, please?"
-1," Oh, sorry sir, I don't have it on me. Honestly, I forgot it back at the house. But I have the insurance policy with me. Here it is. "
0," Please wait here, sir. I'll come back in a moment."
0," Excuse me, sir, didn't you see the red light?"
-1," Oh, I thought I could make a right turn on red here. "
-1," No, sir. The sign says No Turn on Red. "
-1," Oh, I guess I didn't see it. "
-1," I'm sorry, sir, but may I see your driver's license and insurance policy, please? I have to give you a ticket. "
0, Here they are.
0," Sign here, please. You can appeal to the court within 14 days. This slip has all the information you need. Please drive safely, sir."
0, Fine.
-1," Excuse me, sir, you can't park here. "
0, I'm just waiting for my friends. It won't be long.
-1," Sir, the curb here is not for parking! "
-1," But I didn't see the sign, Ma'am. "
-1," There's a sign at the corner of the street. When you turned in here, you should've seen it. "
-1, I didn't see it. 
-1," I'm sorry, sir. I have to give you a ticket. You can appeal to the court within 14 days. You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault. "
0, How is everything with you today?
1, I'm fine. Thank you for asking.
0, Can I help you with something?
0, I actually have a few questions about the apartment.
0, What questions do you have?
0, Is this apartment in a nice location?
1, It is in a great location.
0, Are there any stores near the apartment?
1, You will find many stores and restaurants near the apartment.
0, Really?
1, I guarantee that the apartment is in a beautiful location.
1, That sounds wonderful.
0, What took you so long?
-1," There was an accident on the freeway, and traffic was bumper to bumper. "
0," Oh, yeah, I just learned from the news on the radio that there was a serious accident involving a truck."
-1, That's right. Traffic was brought to a standstill. 
0," Anyway, thank Heaven that you arrived safe and sound. But, we'd better get going. We're running a little bit late."
0, I heard you're going to LA tonight.
0, Yes. I'm having a dinner party with my friends there.
0," Well, you may not know this, but because it's Christmas tomorrow, everybody gets off work early today so that they can go back home early. Starting at 3, traffic usually becomes bumper to bumper."
0," Oh, I didn't know that. Well, I'll leave earlier today then. Say 2 PM."
0," That would be my advice. If you don't have any important things to deal with, leave as early as possible."
-1," Oh, my goodness, the traffic is crawling. "
-1, I think there's an accident ahead. 
-1, We're now running late. 
0, I know. Why don't we take a different route?
0," Let me take a look at the map. Yes, there's an exit three quarters of a mile ahead. We'll exit NAMEet Street, head west, and then get on the Pennsylvania Freeway."
0," OK, let's do that even though we may have to take a longer way."
0, What are you doing this weekend?
0, We're going to take the train to my mother's house.
1, That should be fun.
0," Yeah. We usually drive, but we decided to take the train this time."
0, Why?
1," My son loves trains, so I thought it would be a good idea to take the train up there."
0, Does he have a train set?
0, Oh yes. He has several trains and NAME built him a big wooden train track.
1, Then he's going to love this ride.
1, I know. We haven't told him yet. It's going to be a surprise.
1, I remember riding the train as a child. It was a lot of fun.
1, One of his toy trains looks just like the train we're going to take.
1, Make sure to take a picture of it.
1, That's a great idea. I'll frame it and hang it on his bedroom wall.
1, Have a great train ride!
0, Are you planning on transferring?
0, Yes. What about you?
0," Yeah, I think so."
0, Where do you want to go?
0, I was thinking either CSULA or UCLA.
1, Those are great schools.
0, Where do you want to transfer to?
0, I'm not really sure yet.
0, You still have time to figure it out.
0, That's true.
1, Hopefully you'll figure it out pretty soon.
1, I will. Good luck with CSULA and UCLA.
0, Are you going to transfer?
0," Yes, I'm going to transfer. Are you?"

1, Good luck figuring it out.
1, I'll figure it out eventually.

0, I want to go to CSULA or UCLA.
1, Those are pretty good schools.
0, Where are you planning on transferring to?

0, I know.
0, What are your plans?
0, What plans are you talking about?

0, I want to transfer.
0, You want to transfer?
0, That's what I plan to do.
0, Where do you want to transfer to?
0, I want to go to school out of state.
0, Which state?
0, Maybe New York.
0, That would be a big move.
0, I'm still thinking about it.
0, Tell me your plans.
0, I'm not sure what plans you're referring to.
0, I'm talking about your college plans.
0, I'm going to transfer colleges.
0, Is that right?
0, That's what I'm working on doing.
0, Where are you going to transfer to?
0," I don't know yet. Somewhere out of state, probably."
0, Which state exactly?
1, New York would be nice.
0, That's pretty far away.
0, I know it's a big move. That's why I'm still thinking about it.
0, What plans have you made?
0, My plans as far as what?
0, Your plans for college.
0, Oh. I plan on transferring.
0," Oh, really?"
0, Yeah. That's the plan.
0, What school are you transferring to?
0, I want to transfer to a school out of state.
0, Which state are you thinking of?
0, I wouldn't mind transferring to a school in New York.
0, That's on the other side of the country.
0," I know, but I'm still weighing my options."
0, I wanted to ask you a few questions.
0, What about?
0, They are pertaining to the neighborhood that the apartment is in.
1, Sure. What would you like to know?
0, What can you tell me about the neighborhood?
-1," In all honesty, the neighborhood could be a little nicer. "
0, What do you mean by that?
-1, The neighborhood streets are a little dirty. 
-1, Is there anything else wrong with the neighborhood? 
0, That's just about it.
1, Hopefully the cleanliness problem will get better.
1," I hope so, too."
0, What classes have you taken so far?
0, I've been working on my GE classes.
0, Is that all?
0, That's it for right now.
0, What about your other classes?
0, I'm working towards transferring schools.
0, Which classes have you finished already?
0, I've finished all my English and math classes.
0, How many classes do you have left for your GE?
0, Only three.
1, That's amazing.
1, I'm almost ready to transfer.
0, Which classes have you completed?
0, I have been taking classes for my General NAMEucation.
0, Those are the only classes?
0, That's all I need to take right now.
0, Why don't you take any other classes?
0, I'm just working on transferring right now.
0, What classes are you done with?

0, I have three more.
1, That's great!
0," I just need three more classes, and I can transfer."
0, What classes have you been taking?
0, I've been taking my GE classes.
0, That's it?
1, That's all that I need right now.
0, Why haven't you been taking any other classes?
0, I'm taking classes so that I can transfer soon.
0, What classes have you taken so far?
0, I don't need to take any more English or math classes.

0," It counts toward my major, but I'm taking it as part of my GE."
0, So you're working on finishing your GE?
1, That's all I'm trying to do right now.
0, Why are you only working on your GE classes?
0," Once I finish those classes, then I can transfer."
0, Are you going to take classes next semester?
0, I plan to.
0, Which classes?
0, I will be taking another English and math class.
0, Is there anything else?

0, Why only your GE classes?
0, I'll be able to transfer once I finish those classes.
0, Were you going to take some classes next semester?
1, Of course!
0, Which ones?
0, I need to take another English and math class.
0, That's it?
0, I think I may also sign up for a psych class.
0, Is the psychology class for your major?
0, That class will count toward my GE and my major.
0, You're just trying to finish your GE?
0, I need to finish these classes for now.
0, I don't understand why you're only working on your GE classes.
0, Because I can't transfer until I finish those classes.
0, What are you doing?

0, Can I help you?

0, Where would you like to transfer to?
0, I haven't figured that out yet.
0, You have more than enough time to figure it out.
0, What must I do to transfer?
0," First, you have to complete your General Eucation."
0, How many GE classes are there?

0," Hello, I'm NAME NAME in unit 23. Am I speaking to the apartment manager?"
0, This is he. How may I help you?
-1, My window that faces the empty lot is broken. 
-1, I'm sorry to hear that. Why is it broken? 
-1, I can't tell you exactly how it happened. 
0," Well, tell me what you think might have happened."
0, I've got a pretty good idea that it's the kids who live here.
0, Why do you think that?
0, Next to the broken glass in my living room was a baseball.
1," Well, you don't need NAME to figure this one out, do you?"
1," Just before I went shopping, I saw them in the lot."
0," Can you give me a name or two, or a description?"
-1, I have absolutely no idea. 
0," I'll call a repairman for you, but it'll probably take one or two days."
1, That's okay.
-1, But let me see the damage first. I'm coming over. 
0," The glass is all cleaned up, so come on over. But do I pay for this?"
-1," No. I will pay your friend, or I will reimburse you if you pay him. "
1, That's good news. I was worried you were going to make me pay for this.
-1, You're not at fault. But the kid who did it is. 
0, May I ask you a couple of questions?
0, What are these questions pertaining to?
0, Just a few questions about the neighborhood.
1, Okay. Ask away.
0, Tell me about the neighborhood.
-1, The neighborhood does have its problems. 
0, How is that?
-1, What I mean is that the streets aren't all that clean. 
-1, Are there any other problems? 
1," Other than it not being so clean, it's actually a nice neighborhood."
1, I'm sure that the problem will eventually be fixed.
1, I hope that you're right.
0, Have you figured out where you want to transfer to?
0, I can't think of where to go.
0, Where would you like to go to school?
0, I really don't know.
0, You can't think of anything?

0, Where are you planning on transferring to?
-1, I can't seem to make a decision. 
0, Where do you want to go?
-1, I honestly have no idea. 
0, You haven't thought about it?
1, I like it here at PCC.
1, Why don't you just continue going to PCC?
1, I like that idea.
1, It's a great school.
1, I completely agree.
0," So, have you made your decision yet?"
1, I'm staying right where I'm at.
0, You got a letter in the mail.

1, It's my acceptance letter from UCLA.
0, What does it say?
1, I've been accepted!

0, You're not nervous?

1, That's for sure.
1, Don't worry about what people think.

-1," Number three, it doesn't run 24 hours. "

0, Why do you say that?
0, The speed limit is 65.
0, I know that.
-1, But you're doing 75. 
0, So is everyone else.
0, But a cop might stop you.
0," No, he won't. Some cars are doing 85."

0, How often do I have to do that?
0, Once every two months.
0, That's a lot.
0, What do you mean?
-1, That's six times a year! 
0," Yes, and it takes about five minutes each time."
0, I'll try.
0, Check your tires or you'll get a flat.
-1, Oh. That's not good. 
0," No, it isn't. A flat costs you time and money."
-1, And I don't have either. 
-1, You're driving too fast. 
-1, I'm in a hurry. 
0, Don't ever be in a hurry.
-1, It's not my fault. You didn't wake me up. 
-1, That's not my fault. You didn't tell me to wake you up. 
0," Well, I meant to."
0, Don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.
0, Why not?
-1, Because you'll have an accident. Most accidents are because people are in a hurry. 
0, How do you know that?
0, I read a lot.
0, I thought drunks caused most accidents.
0, Let's go for a ride.
0, Where are we going?

1, What are we waiting for?
1, Let me get the keys.
1, Let me get my camera.
0, I have to go to the bathroom.
0, Why didn't you go before we left?
-1," I did, but I have to go again. "
0," Well, hold on a little longer."
-1, I think I'm going to explode. 
0, Just hold on.
-1, Oh! Don't hit any more bumps! 
0, We'll be at McDonald's in just a few minutes.
-1, I hope they are fast minutes. 
0, Think about something else. Think about a hamburger.
-1," I'm thinking, but I still have to go. "
0, It's the next exit. Hold on!
0, Where's the car?
0, What do you mean?
0, The car isn't here.
0, Where did you park it?
0, I parked it right here.
0, Are you sure?

0," No, this is the tree."
0, Did someone steal it?
0, I sure hope not.
0, Maybe they towed it away.
0, Look at this traffic.
0, I'd rather not.

-1, The speed limit is 65! 
0," Well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m."
0, Where are all these people going?
0, They're all asking the same question.
0, When are they going to fix this problem?
0, They said they need more money.
-1, They always need more money. 
-1, It'll get worse before it gets better. 
0, Did you see that car?
0," Yes, he went through the red light."
0, Can we call the police?
-1," No, the police don't care. "
0, Why not?
0, They have to see it happen.
-1, They don't believe us? 
-1, No. They can only give a ticket if they see it happen. 
0," So, what do we do?"
0, We don't do anything.
0, Maybe we should honk the horn next time.
0, The driver will just honk back at us.
-1, My car is dirty.

0, What don't you like about your room?

0, I would like to speak with someone in the Housing Department.
0, You have reached the right area. Can I help you with something?
-1, I think that I may have experienced discrimination in trying to rent an apartment. 
0, Can you be specific as to what type of discrimination?

1," If we are lucky, maybe they'll have some great food at the pub for supper."
-1, This rain sort of blows our chances of going rollerblading! 
-1," No, I don't think that we will be able to do what we planned to do. What can we do for fun today? "

0, They told me inside that I should catch the Super Shuttle here.
0, You are in the right place to catch the Super Shuttle. What is your destination?
0, I am trying to get to my home in Pasadena.

0, I am hoping that this shuttle goes straight to my city without making a bunch of stops.
0, Always ask the driver how many stops he plans to make before you pay him.

0, Did you forget to check the gas?
0," Oh, I'm low on gas. I've got to refill the tank."
0," Well, there's a gas station across the street and it's not too expensive. About $1.19 per gallon for the mid-grade."

0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is NAME. Is NAME going trick-or-treating this year?
0, I think so.
0, NAME doesn't want to go?
0, Why?
0, She thinks it's for little kids.
1, That's funny. She's only 9 years old.
0, I know. She thinks it's for babies.
0, Tell her that babies cannot eat candy.
-1, She said Halloween is boring. 
-1, What if she changes her mind after Halloween is over? It's only once a year. 
0, Then she has to wait another year.
0, Maybe NAME can talk to her.
0, Where are you and NAME going?
0, Just around our neighborhood. There are a lot of homes around here.
-1, We live in an apartment. Maybe that's why it's boring. There aren't many kids here. 
1, Bring NAME here on Halloween. We can all go together.
1, What a great idea! Thanks!
0, Hi NAME. What are you doing at a travel agency? Are you planning a trip?
1, Oh Hi NAME. My son is graduating college and NAME and I thought a trip would be a good graduation gift.
1, That's a great graduation gift! He's a lucky boy.
1," He's a good son, so NAME and I wanted to give him something special."
0, Where are you sending him?
0, China. He studied the Chinese language in college and really enjoyed learning about the culture.
0, Does he know anyone there?

-1, That sounds boring. 
1, It's very relaxing.
1, I like being in the city.
0, Do you want to try a new restaurant tonight?
-1, Sure. I'm kind of getting sick of the same place. 
0, Me too. What kind of food do you want to eat?
0, Do you want to try Indian?
1," Ok. I've never had Indian food before, so you'll have to choose the place."
0, I've never had it before either.
0, Then why do you want to go there?
1, To try something different.
0, Let's check out the reviews online.
1, That's a good idea.

0," Hello, Mr. NAME"
0," NAME mentioned to me that you have a Pizza and Hamburger lunch day every other week. He would like to participate, is there a form I need to complete. I assume there is a fee as well?"
-1," I'm very sorry, Mr. NAME. Unfortunately the lunch is organized by volunteer parents at the start of each semester. It's probably too late to add another child this time, but in January he will receive an order form for Pizza and Hamburger day for the winter semester. However, I will ask the lead volunteer if he can be added sooner. "
1, OK. I understand. Thank you.
1," You are very welcome, Mr. NAME."
0, How may I help you?
1," I want to buy two mackerel, please."

1," Yes, no problem. Here you are."
1, Thank you. Bye.
0," Hi, I am looking for ground pork but I can't find it with the fresh meat. Do you have it in the back?"
-1," I'll take a look, one moment, please. Unfortunately we don't have any right now. "
0, Then can you grind this pork for me?
0," Yes, I can. But I have to grind the whole piece. Do you want that much?"
1, Yes. That's fine.
0, It will take me a few minutes to set up the grinder and package it. Would you like to pick up your other items and come back?
1," Thank you, that's a good idea. I'll come back shortly."

-1, What will happen if I move out before then? 
-1," If you move out before then, you will not get your deductible. "

0, Because our contract says that you will live here for three years.
-1," Okay, I think that I understand. "
1, I'm glad you understand.
0, May I help the next person?
1," Yes, I want 2kg of this sirloin. I would like it sliced thin for Chinese Fondue. Do you know how to cut it?"
0, This piece weighs 1.85 kg. Is that close enough?
1," Yes, that will be fine. Can you cut it thin please?"
0, How is this?

1," NAME is a wonderful child. It is a real pleasure having her in my class this year. I try to teach the children that science can be fun. It's hard for them to fully understand every concept we cover. At this age they are all growing and developing so fast, sometimes they just need a little extra time. NAME has been struggling with understanding some concepts, but she is a hard worker and I am sure she will be fine."
0, I see. Then how can I help her? Do you have any suggestions?
0," I will send her science duo tang home with her after the every science class so you will know exactly which units she learned at school. If she doesn't understand some parts of it, you can explain that to her in Japanese or English. You may wish to consider some extra help, perhaps a tutor or after school program. There's also a wide range of resources on the Internet today. Many people speak very highly of Khan Academy, it is a non profit organization that produces online educational content."

1," Oh, I see."
1, All right. I'm glad I could clarify things for you.
0," Hi, How are you?"
1," I'm doing fine, how about you?"

-1, My girls are busy too. They are both in ballet class. They are having a fall recital in October and are having daily rehearsals. 
0," I guess that's why I haven't see you recently. Anyway, when you have some time, call me. We should get together for tea."
1, That'll be very nice.
1," Well, I better get back to making a snack before football. Good luck with all the activities!"

0, Just because you work for a week doesn't mean that you will be losing your benefits.
0, How do I know when to tell EDD that have I started a new job?
0," Work is work, whether it's a part time or temporary job or a full time gig."
0, So I guess I have to report that I've found a little bit of work.
0," All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim Form, and the EDD Office will take care of the rest."
0, What about if I find a job that I know will only last for a couple of weeks? Can I take it?
0, It is to your advantage to work as much as you can.

0, Hi NAME. How are you?

0, That was the only problem that I saw.
1, I'm glad that everything else is to your liking.
1, I honestly love it.
0," You heard who won the election, right?"
0, Who was elected?
0, NAME won the election.
-1, That can't be true! 
-1," I'm upset, too. "
-1, I can't believe people voted for him. 
0, People must want him as our President.
-1, That doesn't make any sense. 
-1, I have more bad news. 
-1, How could the news get any worse? 
1," I was only kidding, because NAME won the election."
1, That's great news!
0, Did you hear who won the election?
0, I can't believe that NAME won.
1, I couldn't be happier to know that he's our new President.
1, I know! He just made history!
1," You voted for him, right?"
1, I did. Did you?
1, I voted for him.
1, I am so happy that he is our new President!
1, So am I.
1, I hope that he brings change to America.
1, I have faith in him.
1, I have faith in our new President.
0," You know who won the election, right?"
1, I'm still shocked that NAME was elected.
1," I couldn't believe it, either."
1, He just made history.
1, I hope you voted for him.
1, Of course I did. Did you?
1, I made sure to vote for him.
1, I am really excited about this.
1, I know how you feel.
1," Hopefully, he'll change things in our nation."
1, I know that he will.
1, I trust him.
0," You heard who won the election, didn't you?"
1, Yeah. I am so excited that NAME won.
1, I'm so happy that he did.
1, That man just made history.
0, Did you vote for him?
1, I sure did! What about you?
1, Of course I did!
1, I am still in shock to know that he was elected.
1," I am, too!"
1, I pray that he actually makes things better in this country.
1, I'm sure that he will.
1," I know he will, too."
0, Can you believe that NAME is our new President?
1, I'm so happy about that.
0, Did you vote for him?
1, I sure did. How about you?
1, I voted for him.
1, I have complete confidence in our new President.
0, Is that right?
1, I know he will help change America.
0," I hope so, because America needs a change."
1," I feel like things are already changing, because he was elected."
1, I agree with you completely.
1, I'm not worried about our country now that it's in his hands.
1, I can't believe NAME is our President!
1, I am proud to know that he is our President.
0," You voted for him, right?"
1," Did you vote for him, because I know that I did."
1," I did, too."
1, I have nothing but faith in NAME.
0, Really?
1, I'm sure he will help better America.
1, We do need some change in this country.
1, Our country is already changing as it is.
1, You're absolutely right.
1, I trust that he will take good care of our country.
0, Can you believe that NAME was actually elected?
1," I can believe it, and I am very excited about it."
1, I hope you voted for him.
1, Of course I did. Didn't you?
1, Of course!
1, I have total faith in NAME as our President.
0, You do?
1, Yeah. I have faith that he will help America turn over a new leaf.
1, Our country really could use some work.
1, I believe that change has already begun.
1, I couldn't agree more.
1, I no longer need to worry about what will happen with this country.
1, I think I want the blue car instead.
0, I thought we agreed to buy the red one.
1, I like the blue one better.
-1, You always change your mind! 
0, This is an expensive purchase.
0, What if you change your mind again after we buy it?
1, I promise I won't change my mind.
0, Ok. Let's buy the blue one.
0, Are you sure? What is wrong with the red one?
0, Nothing. You said you wanted blue.
0, Can you keep an eye on my seat?
0, Yeah. Where are you going?
0, I'm going to get a glass of beer.
0, Can you get me one too?
0, Sure. Do you want a draught or a bottle?
0, Bottle. Here's $10.
0, Could you do me a big favor?
0, What is it?
-1, My dog sitter is sick. Could you watch my dog for a few days? 
0, How long will you be gone?
0, For three days.
0, How many times a day should I walk him?
0," Twice a day, please."
1, He's going to give me a lot of exercise.
1, Thank you so much!
1, No problem. He's a great dog!
0, Do you like the apartment?
1, I absolutely love the apartment.
0, Everything is okay?
-1, I do have one problem with the apartment. 
0, What's the problem?
-1, I don't like all those stains in the carpet. 
1, We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment.
1, I did not know that.
1," I assure you that we will, and if there are any more problems, feel free to tell me."
1, That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment.
1, I'm glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice.
1, It's absolutely incredible. I'll take it.
-1," Oh, my! It's really hot! I've never seen such scorching weather in my life£¡ "
-1, Tell me about it. It's like the whole world is broiling. 
-1," Oh, look at the thermometer! The temperature has hit 98! "
-1, I hope it's not gonna break into three digits! 
-1, But it's already awfully close! 
-1," Well, I just hope it'll level off. "
-1, I guess we can't do anything until after dark then. 
-1, I guess so. What else can we do? You can't stay in the heat for long! 
-1," Oh, man! Nobody can stand this kind of scorching heat. "
-1, Tell me about it! You can't even stay in the sun for five minutes. 
-1, You'll be scorched like a shrivelled plant. 
-1, Or like a shrivelled old man! 
-1," I like your humor, B . Anyway, I guess this afternoon there's nothing we can do but stay home. "
-1, I guess so. I don't want to be taken to the hospital for heat exhaustion or sunstroke or something. 
-1, You want my advice? Drink a lot of liquids and spare yourself the worst of the heat! 
0," Yeah, you're right. Got to drink a lot of fluids. Do we have any beer?"
0, Yes. Do you want Coors Light or Corona?
0, Do you have any Bud or Michelobe?
-1," Oh, the heat is unbearable! Didn't you turn on the air conditioner? "
-1, The heat has blown our air conditioner on the roof! 
-1," What the fuck! So, what are we going to do? "
0, We've got to have it fixed as soon as possible. I've called someone and they're on the way.
1, Thank God!
0, Here you go. You can use the electric fan here. At least you can catch a breeze.
-1," Oh, the heat is unbearable! Didn't you turn on the air conditioner? "
-1, The heat has blown our air conditioner on the roof! 
-1," What the fuck! So, what are we going to do? "
0, We've got to have it fixed as soon as possible. I've called someone and they're on the way.
-1," What's going on? When you turn on the faucet, it's just drip, drip, drip. "
-1," Well, it's the second day in a row. I guess the pipes are frozen again. "
0, Really?
-1," Yeah. Yesterday the water even went off without a warning. I couldn't take a shower, nor could I wash the dishes. "
-1," Well, I'm wondering why the manger isn't on top of this! "
-1," Wow, you look like a drowned rat! Didn't you know there's a thunderstorm today? "
-1," I knew there would be a shower, but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today. "
-1," Well, you'd better take a hot shower right now, or you'll catch a cold. "
-1," I know. I don't want to get sick, especially during finals week. "
-1, I think a drought has set in. It hasn't rained a drop for months. 
0," I think so, too, but didn't it rain last month?"
-1," It did rain last month, but the rainfall was only half the monthly average. "
-1, Oh. That bad?! 
-1, That's right. It's really bad. I'm really concerned though not panicked yet. 
-1, I don't blame you. The pastures have browned out even before the summer hasn't arrived. 
-1," Yeah, and the soil has been baked so hard that the plow can't even break the soil. "
-1, Looks like it's going to be an ongoing thing that would get worse each day. 
-1," Yeah. If it doesn't rain, it's going to get critical. "
-1," Did you hear that? The drought conditions are severe! There's a lot of death, dying, and suffering out there! "
-1," I heard that, but it's not surprising actually, cause we haven't had as much rain as normal this year. "
0," Well, if it could rain even a drop, things would be much better! And my flowers in the garden would come back in a heartbeat."
0," I guess you might have to quit watering your garden. I heard that they are going to start rationing water. In fact, this morning I happened to hear on the radio that the reservoir had dipped below half its capacity this month and the volume of water entering the reservoir is the smallest in fifty years."
1, Really! I thought that might happen. Great! There go my vegetables!
0, I guess so. But think about Africa.
0," Hello, NAME."
0, Hi NAME.
0, Can you explain something to me?
0, Sure. What is it?
0, What is Halloween?
0, Oh. It's a holiday that we celebrate once a year.
0, Is it the same date every year?
0, Yes. It's on October 31.
0, What do people do on that day?
0, People dress up in costumes and go to other people's homes to collect candy.
0, Even strangers' homes?
0, Yes. They knock on the doors and say 'Trick or Treat.' Then the home owner gives out candy.
0," Do adults do it, too?"
0, Not many adults. It's usually just children.
0, Isn't that unsafe?
0, It can be. But parents go with them.
0, I see. My son wants to do it this year. I didn't know what it was.
0, You don't do this in your native country?
0, No. I guess it's a new tradition we have to learn.
1, It's a lot of fun. Your son will enjoy it.
0," Hey NAME, what are you doing?"
0," Oh, hi NAME. I'm setting up tables and chairs for a family BBQ."
0, Is it a special occasion?
0, Tomorrow is the fourth of July.
0," I know that tomorrow is July 4, but what is so important about it?"
0, You don't know. It's our country's Independence Day.
0, What do you mean Independence Day?
0," On July 4, 1776, our country's founders declared independence from the rulers of Great Britain."
0, How did America declare independence?
1, We went to war against Great Britain called the Revolutionary War and won.
0, Wow! I didn't know that.
0," Yeah. So, now the United States celebrates this day every year."
0, How do you celebrate?
0, We usually have a big BBQ party. Then we light fireworks when it gets dark.
1," Oh, those loud and colorful explosions in the sky?"
0, Yeah. Would you like to come over and watch them with our family?
0," Sure. Can I bring my children, too?"
1," Of course. They will enjoy them. But it is very dangerous, so we have to watch the kids carefully."
0, What are your thoughts on the apartment?
1, I think that it's absolutely gorgeous.
0, There aren't any problems with the apartment?
-1," I think that the apartment looks very nice, but I do see some problems. "
-1, What problems? 
-1, I did notice a few stains in the carpet. 
1, We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in.
0, You will?
0," Yes, but other than that, are there any more problems?"
1, That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment.
1, I'm happy that you find this apartment so appealing.
1, It is. I love it.
0, Hi NAME.
0, Hi NAME.
0, I have a question about Thanksgiving. What does that day mean?
1, It's an American holiday that's celebrated once a year.
0, What is the date?
0, There is no actual date. It is different every year. It is on the fourth Thursday in November.
1, That's interesting. Why do Americans celebrate this day?
0, It first started many years ago after the pilgrims settled in America. They wanted to celebrate the first harvest after settling in America.
0," Oh, I see. Is there anything special Americans do on that day like fireworks on the 4th of July?"
0, We typically roast a whole turkey and make lots of other dishes like potatoes and stuffing.
1, Wow! That sounds like a feast. Can your family eat all of that?
1, We invite our relatives and celebrate this day together.
0, It's like a family reunion.
1," It is! And, pumpkin pie is usually the dessert because pumpkins are in season in the Fall."
1, It sounds like a nice tradition.
1," Nowadays, many people celebrate this day to give thanks for all of their blessings like family and good health."
1, I like this tradition. Maybe I will roast a turkey this year. Will you teach me?
1, Sure. I would love to. I have many great recipes I can share with you.
-1, I'm nervous about this trip. 
0, Why?
0, I'm meeting with the CFO.
-1, Wow! That would make me nervous too. 
0, What should I pack?
0," Well, you should definitely bring your laptop and tablet."
0, I know. What else?
0, Bring a suit.
0, I don't own a suit.
0," Well, you better go shopping then."
0, I'd like to return these boots.
0, Is there anything wrong with them?
-1, Yes. They are very uncomfortable. 
-1, I think you have had these for a long time. It looks like you have already worn them a lot. 
-1, Are you saying I can't return them? 
-1, We only accept returns on unused items. 
-1, Where is the manager? I demand a refund now! 
0," Hey NAME, what are you going to do this Winter Break?"
0," I'm going skiing with some friends. What about you, NAME?"
0, I'm going to visit my parents for a few days.
1, That's nice. Do they live near?
0, No. They live in New York.
0, Does it snow a lot during the winter there?
1, Yeah. It's beautiful. I take a lot of pictures since we don't get much snow here.
0, Is that where your hometown is?
0, Yeah. I miss seeing snow.
1, You should go skiing with us one day. There's a lot of snow in the mountains during the winter.
0, That's an idea. But I don't know how to ski?
0," You don't know how to ski, but you love snow?"
-1," Yeah, we didn't do much skiing growing up. "
1, I'll teach you then. Skiing is fun!
1, That's ok. I'd rather just drink hot chocolate and snuggle in warm blankets by the fireplace.
1," Winter is the best time for that, too!"
0," NAME, you're always busy. How do you maintain a good work life balance?"
0," It's hard, but I try."
0, How do you do it?
0, I don't stay at work too late.
0, Do you have any other advice?
0, Don't work at home. Try to have a personal life too.
-1, That's hard for me. I have so much to do. 
0, I understand. But try to make priorities.
1, I'm going to do that. I want to have some fun in my life too.
1, Enjoying life is healthy for you.
0, How do you balance your work life and your personal life?
0, I don't bring my work home.
0, What do you mean?
0, Don't do more than you can handle.
0, What if you have a lot of work to do?
0," Then I stay at the office and finish it. When I go home, I focus on home only."
0, I wish I was like you.
0, Hey NAME. What was your first job?
0, I worked at a fast food restaurant.
0, Did you like it?
0, It was ok. It was always busy.
0, What did you do there?
0, I took orders at the counter and sometimes at the drive thru window.
0, Was it fun?
-1, It wasn't fun. It was just a job. We had to work fast. 
0, I need to find a job. I was thinking about applying at a fast food restaurant.
1, It's a good place to learn how to work quickly.
1, I'm a fast learner and I can move pretty quickly.
1," Also, it's a good place to learn how to handle customers."
-1, I don't have any customer service experience. 
1, They will train you. You just have to be polite and listen well.
1, I can do that.
0, You should apply then.
0, Did you get to eat a lot of the food?
-1, I ate too much fast food working there. I got sick of it. 
1, I love fast food. I may eat it every day.
-1, That's probably not a good thing. 
0, Were you here yesterday?
0, No. I don't come into the office every day.
0, Do you work from home?
0, Yes. I just make sure I work 40 hours a week.
1, You're so lucky.
1, I know. My boss gave me a flexible schedule because I am a single parent.
1, You have a very understanding boss.
1, I know. I'm very lucky.
1, I would love to work from home.
1, Maybe you should ask your boss about working a flexible schedule too.
0," Hey NAME, have you been working out?"
0," Hey NAME. Yeah, I've been going to the gym every day before work."
-1," I need to go too, but I'm so lazy now. "
1," I needed to lose a few pounds. That's what motivated me. Now, I just like going."
-1, I need to lose some weight too. I gained around 20 pounds this year. 
1, You did? Why don't you come with me tomorrow morning?
0, What time do you go in the morning?
0, 5 am. I work out for about an hour.
0, 5 am? That's too early.
1, You should try it. It feels great to work out early in the morning.
0, I'm asleep at 5 am.
0, I'll wake you up tomorrow morning. We can start slow by doing just a little running on the treadmill.
-1, I hate running. 
0," Ok, how about lifting weights?"
-1, I don't have the strength to lift weights. 
0, Ok. How about aerobics?
-1, That's too much jumping around? 
0, Yoga?
-1, Too boring. 
-1," You're right, NAME. You're too lazy to work out. "
0, Are you working overtime again?
-1, Yeah. I have a lot to do. 
0, Does it bother you?
0," Not really. I don't have a family, so I don't feel bad about working late."
0, What about your social life?
-1, I don't have time for a social life. I'm too busy working. 
0," Hello, I was hoping you could give me more info about your apartment."
0, I can try to help you. What would you like to know?
0, Is there access to public transportation near the apartment?
1, I'm pretty sure there's a bus stop within walking distance.
0, Do you know anything about the buses that stop there?
0," I don't know, but I'm pretty sure you can find out that stuff online."
1, I think the local library has bus info.
1, Good luck. The bus info shouldn't be too hard to find.
0," Hey, what's up?"
1, Everything's fine with me. How about you?
0, I need your help.
0, What do you need?
0, Remember when I told you I'm going to be moving?
0," Yeah, I remember."
0, Do you think you could help me move?
1," Sure, that shouldn't be a problem. When?"
0, Are you busy this Saturday?
1, I don't think I have any plans.
0, Is 10 o'clock okay with you?
1, That'll be fine. I'll see you then.
-1, I'm so busy these days. 
0, Do you have another deadline?
-1, Yes. I've been working every weekend. 
0, How does your family feel about it?
-1, They are not happy about it. 
0, Working full time while raising kids is hard work.
0," Dad, I need help with my project."
0, What do you need help with?
-1, Everything. Nothing is going right. 
0, What's wrong?
-1, My model keeps falling apart. 
0, It looks like your glue is not strong enough.
0, This is the only glue I have.
0, I have stronger glue in the garage. Let me get it.
1," Thanks, Dad!"
0, Be very careful with it. This glue is very powerful.
0, Did you see NAME today?
-1, Yes. But why does she have such a long face? 
-1, I don't have the foggiest idea. 
0, I thought she'd be happy.
0," Yeah, especially since she got a promotion recently."
0, Maybe it's some kind of personal problem.
0, What are the chances of getting a raise this year?
-1, Chances are slim! 
-1, Wow! You haven't gotten a raise for how many years now? 
-1, It's been three years! The company keeps losing money and they can't afford to give anyone a raise. 
-1, That's too bad. Did you ever think of working somewhere else? 
0," Yeah. In fact, I have an interview next Monday."
1, Good luck!
0," NAME, don't you think you should take a vacation? Even one or two days would be fine."
-1, There's no way. There's too much work. 
-1, But you look so exhausted. You need a break! 
-1, I know. My chances would be better if they would hire more people. 
0, They won't hire more people?
-1, No. They always want to keep the cost down. I am really overwhelmed with a heavy workload. 
0, Maybe you should talk to the manager.
0, Yes. I'm going to bring this up in tomorrow's meeting.
1, You type fast!
1," Yup. I'm not boasting, but I type 80 words per minute."
0," Really? I wish I could type that fast. I use the hunt and peck method. You know, I look for the key I want and then I hit it with one finger. I just can't seem to get my hands to move any faster than that."
0," Well, there's no trick to typing quickly. You just need to practice. Once you get the hang of it, you'll find that it's really not as difficult as you think. In fact, it just becomes instinct to know what to do at the keyboard. But if you don't practice, it will never come naturally."
0," So, how was your interview?"
-1, I haven't gone to the interview yet. It's tomorrow. I'm so nervous. 
1, Don't worry. You should do fine. You have the experience.
1, I hope so.
1," Remember, they want someone who works well with people. You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are!"
1, Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.
0," Hi, NAME. I heard you're looking for a new job."
0, Yeah. I just had an interview yesterday.
0, Oh. How did it go?
1, I think I did well. They said they would make a decision by this Friday.
0, This Friday? Looks like they want to hire the person as quickly as possible.
1," Yeah! I think so, too."
0, What are your chances of getting that job?
1, I believe I have a very good chance. The director seems to like me.
1," Well, good luck, then."
1, Thanks. I hope it helps.
-1, Why does the CFO look so upset? 
-1, The stock market crashed. 
-1, What about the employees' stocks? 
-1, Our stocks are worth nothing. 
-1, Are you serious? 
-1, Yes. The company stocks have no value. 
-1, What am I going to do? 
-1, What are we all going to do? 
-1, That was going to be my retirement fund. 
-1, I was going to use that to pay my son's college tuition. 
-1, I have a problem with my online order. 
0, What is the problem?
-1," I order a black jacket, but I received a white one. "
-1, I'm very sorry to hear that. We can exchange the jacket for you. 
0, How do I return the wrong one?
0, You can return it by mail or return it to one of our stores.
0, What's going on?
1, Things are fine with me. What's going on with you?
1, Would you help me?
0, Help you with what?
0," You do know I'm getting ready to move, right?"
1, I remember you telling me.
0, Do you mind helping me move in?
1, I can help you with that.
0, Is this Saturday okay for you?
1, I'm free this Saturday.
0, Can you come help me at 10:00?
1, That's perfect. I will see you on Saturday.
-1, I have a problem with my online order. 
0, What is the problem?
-1," I ordered red roses for my wife, but she received daisies. "
-1, I'm sorry to hear that. 
-1, It is our anniversary and roses are her favorite flowers. 
0, I will have red roses delivered to her as soon as possible.
0, What should I do with the daisies?
0, Please keep them since we made the error.
1, That's very nice of you.
1, I hope your wife enjoys both flower bouquets.
-1, Why are we getting so many wrong phone calls? 
0, The newspaper accidentally put the wrong number in someone's ad.
0, What kind of ad is it?
0, An ad for a pizza place.
0, That's why the callers keep asking me if we have any specials this week.
0, Did you tell them we deliver?
1, That's funny.
0," Good afternoon, Mrs. NAME."
-1, Hello NAME. Why do you look so sad? 
-1," I need to find a part time job this summer. I want to buy a new guitar, but I don't have enough money. "
0," Well, can you do yard work?"
1, Yes! I do yard work for our house all the time. What do you need done?
0, How about mowing and watering the lawn?
1, I can do both of those things.
-1," NAME and I are getting too old to do it. Our son used to take care of our yard, but he moved to another state. "
0, I see.
0, When can you start?
1, I can start right now!
1, That would be wonderful. The grass is growing really high.
0, Mrs. NAME.
0," Yes, NAME."
0, May I ask how much the pay is?
0, Of course. Silly me. How does $30 a week sound?
1," That sounds great! Thank you, Mrs. NAME."
1," If you do a good job, I may give you more work. I need someone to paint my fence."
1, I would love to! I will start mowing now.
1," You're a good boy, NAME."
-1, You stole my project idea. 
-1, I did not. That was my idea.

1," Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?"
1," I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too."
0, What time do you usually hit the sack?
0," Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day."
0, What about smoking?
-1," If I ever get elected President, I will ban smoking nationwide. "

1," It's called dabu-dabu. A traditional hot, sour and spicy condiment from Manado, north Sulawesi."
1," Alright, I should try it. Hmmmm it's really good! I love it!"
0," Hi, NAME. This is NAME from apartment 4C."
0," Oh, hi, NAME."
-1, There is something wrong with my garbage disposal.

0, When did this happen?
0," Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange."
0, Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?
-1, No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it. 
-1," Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal. "
-1," Well, no one ever told me that. "
0, Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?
-1, I don't have a key. 
0," Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it."
0," Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."
0," If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman."
0, How have you been?
1, I'm fine. What's going on?
0, I would like to talk to you about something.
0, What about?
0, I'm planning on moving out soon.
0, When will you be doing this?
0, I will be moving out a few weeks from now.
0, Why is that?
0, I have to leave the state for school.
1, That's all right.
1, I'm glad that you're okay with this.
1, I'm absolutely cool with it.
-1," I received an eviction notice from you, and I don't understand what it means. "
-1," Well, you are behind in your rent; it's a 30-day notice to vacate. "
-1, You can't make me move just for being late with my rent. 
-1, You have been late with your rent several times now. I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself. 
-1, Are you throwing me out? 
-1, This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don't make good on your rent. 
0," If I catch up on my rent, can I stay?"
0," You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up. Otherwise, I will find another renter."

0," Actually, it is a 30-day notice to vacate the premises."
-1, Just for being a few days late?

-1, Are you taking my apartment away? 
-1, This is a notice to inform you that the sheriff will evict you in 30 days if you do not pay up on your rent. 
0, Can I keep the apartment if I pay my rent in full?
0," You can keep the apartment if you stay caught up on your rent. Otherwise, I need to find someone who can make the payments."
0, What is this eviction notice for?
-1, The notice you received is a 30-day notice to vacate. 
-1, Are you kidding me? 
-1, I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent. This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business. 
-1, You can't just throw me out on the street! 
-1," You have 30 days to catch up on your rent, or a sheriff will evict you. "
0, Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment?
-1," You can stay, but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments. "
1, I am going to take care of the rent payment right now.
1, Thank you. The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier's check.
e., I like this apartment. I want to stay her
0, Take care of your rent.

0, You still have time on your lease.
-1, There's no way that I can stay here. 
-1, That's not going to be all right. 
-1, I don't understand why. 
-1, I'm going to have to keep your deposit. 
-1, Why can't I have it back? 
-1, Because you're leaving before your lease is over. 
-1, You have to give it back to me. 
-1, You're not going to get it. 
-1, But I'm not able to live here anymore.

0, How much does it cost?
0, I'm selling it for $2500.
-1, That can't be right. 
0, That's the going price for that particular TV.
-1, I can't afford that. 
1, This is a very high quality television.
1, I would buy it if the price was lowered.
0, How much lower?
0, How about you sell it to me for $2000?
-1, $2500 is a low as I'll go.

0, Did it die suddenly?
-1, It started to make a weird sound last week. 
-1," You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you? "
0," No, that's against the law, isn't it? I only use it on soft food, maybe once a week."
-1," Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently. "
-1," Once a week might not be enough, huh? "
0, There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up.
-1," Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it. "
0, How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?
0," Come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys."
-1, The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman. 
1, It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not.
-1," Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we? "
-1, I have an issue.

1, Ha ha yes! Cooking with coconut milk gives better flavor anda taste! But it can be harmful if you consume it excessively. You had better consume it in moderation. How about boiled or steamed food?

-1, I think I change my mind. I will try different thing. I don't want to place too much reliance on being an employee. I will try to run a business. 
0, What business will you run?
0, Do you think that running a food stall will be prospecting nowadays?
0, It can be. But have you prepared yourself mentally and financially?
1, I can start from what I have and I'm very ready to do it.
-1, You should choose a strategic place and the right segment too. You must do a very careful research to make a good result.

1," Good morning, Brother company how may I help you?"
0," Good morning, I'm NAME from NAME. Could you please put me through Mrs. NAME?"

0, Is it true that the frequent use of antibiotics to treat infections can result in an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria?
-1," Yes, many experts said so. The problem is not many people know about the harm of too much antibiotics. "

1," Hi, NAME. This is NAME here. Do you want some good news?"
1," Sure, let me have it."

1," Wow, that's fantastic! I don't know what to say."
-1," Now you can't move in, of course, until you've paid some fees. "

1, Oh I see. So I'll try now. Thanks for your help.
1, Likewise Ma'am.
0, Did you meet a lot of people yesterday?
-1," Yes, but I don't think I made a good first impression. "
0, What happened?
-1, I was trying to act too cool. I don't think they took me seriously. 
0, Did you give them your business card?
-1," I forgot them, so I wrote my contact info on napkins. "
-1, Oh. That's not very professional looking. 
0, I know. What am I going to do?
0, Where is your favorite vacation spot?
1, NAME and I love to go to Hawaii every summer.
-1, NAME and I have never been there. 
1, It's a beautiful and relaxing place.
0, NAME doesn't like beaches. He likes to sightsee.
0, There are many places to sightsee.
0, I may have to talk him into it.
1, We have a lovely condo you could stay in.
0, How much do you charge?
1, We won't charge you. You're my best friend.
0, What's going on in NAME's office?
0, NAME is having a meeting with NAME.
0, About what?
-1, NAME's constant complaining. 
0, Finally!
-1, I know. NAME is a tough woman. 
0, I wonder what NAME is saying.
-1, It doesn't look good. 
0, How do you know?
-1, NAME is crying. 
0, Do you think you can get this stain out?
0, I think you should take it to the dry cleaners.
1, That is my favorite shirt.
-1, You should be more careful with it! 
0, I know. Do you think the dry cleaners can get it out?
-1, I don't know. 
-1, I can't understand why everyone wants to see this movie. 
1, It's really funny.
-1, It's not funny at all. 
0, Have you seen it?
-1, Yes. It was boring. 
-1, You don't have a sense of humor. 
-1, NAME is such a brown-noser! 
0, What happened?
-1, He follows NAME everywhere. 
-1," Oh, he always does that! "
-1, It's so annoying. He says bad things about NAME all the time. 
-1," I know. But when he sees him, he acts like NAME is the greatest guy in the whole world. "
0, Are you ready to go?
-1, I don't feel like going out tonight. 
-1, You always change your mind at the last minute. 
-1, I'm sorry. I'm just really tired today. 
0, But I already bought the concert tickets.
0, Can you call one of your friends?
0, What is NAME doing?
0, She's organizing her office.
0, Again? She is always organizing her office.
0, Everything has to be in the right place.
-1, I know. One time she got mad at me because I accidentally moved her plant. 
1, That's funny.
-1, That's not funny. She got very mad at me. 
-1, Then don't move her things. 
-1, I will never touch anything in her office again. 
-1, She's just a neat freak. 
0," Hi, this is NAME."
0," Hi, NAME. NAME here. I think you've got a good idea why I'm calling."
0," Yes. It's about the rent, isn't it?"
-1," Yes, your rent is late. This is the second month in a row. "
0, But I thought that I had a grace period.
-1, I told you last month that the rental agreement contains no grace period. 
0," Oh, I guess I was thinking about the last place that I lived."
0," Well, tell me when I'm going to get your rent."
0," I get paid tomorrow, so you'll get the check by Monday."
-1, Don't forget to include the $50 late fee. 
0, Are you sure a late fee is in the rental agreement?
-1, How could you miss the late fee? It's circled in red ink! 
-1, I can't find my copy of the rental agreement. I know it's somewhere in my apartment. 
-1," If you're late one more time, I'm probably going to evict you. "
0, Let's go hang out at the coffee shop.
0, We always hang out at the coffee shop. Let's do something else.
1, I thought you loved hanging out there.
0," I do, but today I want to do something different."
1," Well, I feel like relaxing with a cup of coffee."
0," How about this? We will go to the coffee shop and have a cup of coffee and talk for a while. After that, we will take a stroll around the lake."
1, That sounds like a good compromise.
0, But you are buying the coffee.
1, Haha. That is fair.
0, What are you doing?
0, I'm waiting to go on a conference call.
0, Who is going to be on the call?
0, My boss and the vice president.
0, Wow! Are you nervous?
0, Yes! This is my first time talking with the vice president.
-1, I've had a bad morning. 
0, What happened?
-1, I had a very difficult customer. 
0, What did the customer do?
-1, She was screaming at me and not listening to anything I was saying. 
-1, No! those are the worst customers. 
1, Your business trips have earned you enough frequent flier miles for a free airline ticket.
1, Really? That's great!
0, Our company lets their employees use the free airline ticket for personal use.
1, Wow! I didn't know that. So good.
0, You should probably use it during your next vacation.
0, I think I will ask my wife where she wants to go.
1, Good idea!
0, Should we go to the beach or the mountains this year?
1, I like the mountains so we can ski.
1, I like the beach so we can swim.
0, We can go to the beach during the summer and the mountains during the winter.
1, That's a great idea. Two family vacations in one year.
1, The kids will love that.
0, Do you like my new bag?
1, It's nice. When did you get it?
0, Today. I got it on sale.
1, That's a designer bag.
1, I know. It's a one-day sale. You should check it out.
1, I think I will. I need a new bag.
0, Can I join you?
1, Sure. But you already bought a new bag.
1, I think I'll get one for my mom too.
1, Let's hurry before everything is sold out.
-1, You missed a great game tonight. 
0, Who won?
1, Your favorite team.
-1, I wish I could've seen it. 
0, Watch the highlights on the sports news.
-1, That's not the same. 
-1, There is something weird going on at work. 
0, What do you mean?
0, The managers have been having secret meetings every day.
0, What do you think is going on?
-1, My hunch is that they are going to close the business. 
0, Why?
-1, Business has been very bad lately. 
-1, Maybe they're going to lay people off instead. 
0, I overheard the owner talking about moving to another state.
0, Your hunch may be right.
-1, I've had a hard day. 
0, Do you want to get drinks after work?
-1, Sure. I need to relax. 
-1, Me too. My boss is putting too much pressure on me. 
-1, I have the same problem. 
0, Let's meet at 6 PM at the bar across the street.
-1, I have a very angry customer on the phone. 
0, What is the problem?
0, The customer says he wants to return his refrigerator.
0, Why? What is wrong with it?
-1, He says it doesn't work anymore. 
0, Did you tell him we would try to fix it for free?
-1, Yes. He won't listen to me. 
0, What is he demanding?
-1, He wants a free replacement right now. 
-1, That is not how our policy works. 
0," Hello, NAME here. Who's calling, please?"
0," Hey, NAME. It's NAME. I'm pretty sure you know why I'm calling."
0," Yes, a dollar gets a dime that you're calling about the rent."
-1," NAME, for the second month in a row, your rent is late. "
0, I thought you said there is a grace period.
-1," No, I didn't. There was no grace period last month, this month, or any month. "
-1, Maybe I'm confusing this place with my last place. 
0," Well, I'm waiting to receive your rent check."
0," I get my money tomorrow, so I can pay you by Monday."
-1," Remember, just like last month, you have to pay the $50 late fee. "
-1, I don't remember seeing a late fee in the rental agreement. 
-1," If you look at your agreement, you'll see the late fee circled in red ink! "
-1, I forget where I put my rental agreement. 
-1," One more late check, and you're looking at eviction. "
0, I have a hunch NAME is seeing someone else.
0, Do you have proof?
-1," No, it's just a hunch. "
0, Why do you think she's dating someone else?
-1, She never returns my calls anymore and she's always busy. 
0, Get proof.
1, We have enjoyed working with you.
1, Thank you. It's been a lot of fun.
1, We would like you to join our team.
0, Are you offering me a job?
1, Yes. We would like you to join our company.
1, Wow! This would be a great business opportunity for me.
0, My secretary will email you the job description and our salary offer.
0, When do you need an answer?
1, We would like an answer by the end of the week.
1, Ok. I will think about it carefully.
-1, I can't believe I have to finish NAME's work again. 
0, Why do you keep doing it for him?
-1," If I don't do it, it'll never get done. "
-1, He's such a slacker. He doesn't do anything at all. 
-1, I don't know why the boss doesn't fire him. 
0, I know why. He's the boss's son.
-1, What a loser! 
-1, Don't let our boss hear you say that. 
-1, I don't care anymore. 
-1, Just don't finish his work and see what the boss does. 
-1, The sink is leaking again. 
0, I'll try to fix it.
0, Let's call a plumber.
0, Why?
0, Because you tried to fix it last time.
0, Let's call a plumber.
0, Can you cover for me?
1, Sure. Where are you going?
0, I need to take a long lunch.
0, Why?
0, I'm going on a job interview.
1," OK, and good luck."
-1, Our company is doing a massive recall. 
0, What is your company recalling?
-1, Spinach. There are reports of e-coli found in some of our spinach. 
-1, That's scary! 
-1, I know. It can be fatal. 
-1, Have there been any deaths? 
-1, We haven't received any reports of deaths yet. 
0, Was someone using my desk?
0, I think NAME was using it yesterday.
-1, I don't like people messing with my things. 
-1, Did she leave a mess? 
-1, My stapler was not in the right place. 
-1, You must be a neat freak. 
-1, Is NAME ever happy? 
0, What happened?
-1, She complains about everything. 
-1, I know. It's annoying. 
-1," If she's so unhappy, she should find another job. "
-1, She would complain about her next job too. 
-1, I'm so nervous! 
0, Why?
0, I just found out that the CEO is going to be at my presentation.
-1, I would be nervous too. 
0, What should I do?
1, Be confident.
0, Is that a new bag?
0, Yes. I got it yesterday.
1, It's beautiful. Do you like it?
-1," It's pretty, but it hurts my shoulder. "
-1, That's not good. What are you going to do? 
0, I think I'm going to return it.
0, Hello. This is NAME.
-1, This is NAME. Let's not play games. You know why I'm calling. 
-1," Oh, not again! You're calling about the rent. "
-1," Yes, your rent check is late, just like last month. "
0, What happened to my grace period?
-1, Why would there be a grace period this month? There wasn't one last month. 
-1, I guess I might be a little confused. 
0, What day in the near future can I expect your check?
1, My boss told me he will pay me tomorrow. You'll get my check by Monday.
0, Remember to include the $50 late fee.
-1, Are you sure the rental agreement included a late fee? 
-1, The red ink around the late fee in your agreement should tell you something. 
-1, I seem to have lost my rental agreement. 
-1," Don't be late again, or you'll be evicted. "
0, I think it's time to buy a new car.
0, Let's get a sports car.
0, I want another SUV.
-1, Why? All of the kids are out of the house now. We don't need a big car anymore. 
1, I feel safer in a SUV.
-1, But I've always wanted a sports car. 
0, Did you hear the news?
0, What news?
0, The company is changing the dress code.
0, What's the new dress code?
0, Every Friday is going to be casual day.
0, What does that mean?
0," We can come to work in casual clothes like jeans, but no inappropriate clothes."
1, That's great! I hate having to wear a suit every day.
0, This is only on Fridays though.
1, That's good enough for me.
0, You need a new look.
-1, What's wrong with my look? 
-1, You should cut your hair. It's old fashioned. 
1, I like my long hair.
1, Try something new.
-1, I'm afraid to. 
1, It's just hair. It will grow back.
-1, It's hard to maintain this long hair. 
0, Can you help us design a new logo?
0, Sure. What kind of logo?
0, We're launching a new brand of clothing.
0, What kind of clothing are you launching?
0, We are making children's clothes.
0, Ok. What kind of logo are you interested in?
1," We want the logo to be unique, but cute."
1, I can do that. Are the clothes for girls or boys?
0, Both.
1, Ok. I will create a design and email it to you soon.
0, I'm quitting my job.
-1, Why? Are you unhappy here? 
1, No. I received a new business opportunity.
1, Wow! That's great. Can you tell me about it?
0, I'll tell you all about it over lunch.
1, Ok. I'm free at noon.
-1, That meeting was a waste of time. 
-1, I agree. We didn't get anything done. 
-1, NAME was against everything. 
-1, She wouldn't listen to anyone's ideas. 
-1, How can the boss handle her negative personality? 
1, They're good friends.
-1, How can NAME have any friends? She is so pessimistic about everything. 
-1, I know. All she does is complain all day. 
0, Should we talk to NAME?
-1, That's not going to do anything. NAME is a naysayer too. 
0, Are you excited about your promotion?
-1," Yeah, but I'm also a little nervous. "
1, Why? You'll do a great job at your new department.
1, I hope my new boss is nice.
1, I heard she is nice but also serious about getting the job done.
1, I always get my job done.
1, Then you shouldn't have any problems.
0, Do you have any advice for me?
1, Be a team player. Get along with your new co-workers.
1, I will! That's really important to me.
1, The new intern is very smart.
1, I know. She works fast too.
1, She seems very ambitious.
1, I think she wants to move up the company quickly.
0, The boss is thinking about hiring her for a permanent position.
1, She's a great worker.
1, She gets along with everyone too.
0," Hey, can you give me a ride to the airport?"
0, When?
0, Tomorrow morning.
-1," I'm sorry, but my car is in the shop. "
0, How long has it been in the shop?
0, A couple of days.
1, That's interesting.
0, What's interesting?
0, I saw you washing your car this morning.
-1, You did? I'm sorry I lied. I just hate morning traffic. 
-1, You always try to get out of helping me. 
0," May I speak with the store manager, please?"
0, I am the store manager. How can I help you?
-1, One of your sales clerks was very rude to me. 
-1, I am very sorry to hear that. Could you please tell me which clerk? 
0, His name is NAME. He works in the mornings.
0, I will talk to NAME as soon as possible.
0," Hi, this is NAME."
0," NAME, it's NAME. You know why I'm calling."
0," Yes, I know. It's the rent, isn't it?"
0," Yes, just like last month, your rent is overdue."
0, What about my grace period?
-1, Are you getting Alzheimer's? There is no grace period in the rental agreement. 
-1, Sometimes my memory isn't so good. Maybe I do have Alzheimer's. 
0, I'm looking forward to receiving your check in the very near future.
0, Is Monday okay? I get paid tomorrow.
0, Remember that the check amount must include the $50 late fee.
0," Okay, if the rental agreement actually has a late fee, I'll pay the fifty dollars."
0, Look at your agreement. There's a big red circle around the late fee.
0," As soon as I find my rental agreement, I'll read it again."
-1," I'm not giving you any more chances. Be late again, and you'll be evicted. "
0, We need to buy a second car.
0, Why?
-1, Our car is getting old. 
0, What kind of car do you want?
1, I would love an SUV. They have more room.
1, A sports car would be fun.
-1, A sports car can't seat a lot of people. 
0, Who are we giving rides to?
0, Our kids and their friends.
-1, We're not their chauffeurs. 
0, Have you seen NAME?
0, No. Did you check his office?
-1, Yes. He's not there. 
0, Try the employee lounge. He's probably sleeping somewhere.
-1, You're right. He never does any work. 
-1, I know. He's such a slacker. 
1, You gave a great presentation.
1, Thanks. I worked really hard on it.
0, I could tell. It was very detailed with lots of information.
1, I hope the CEO was impressed.
1, I think she was. I saw her smile a few times.
1, That's good to hear.
0, There goes NAME again.
0, What is he doing?
-1, NAME nosing the boss. 
0, What do you mean?
-1, He treats the boss like a king and does everything he says. 
0," Oh, I see. Yeah, I've seen him do that."
-1, It's ridiculous. 
-1, I thought NAME didn't like the boss. 
-1, He doesn't like him. He just wants a promotion. 
-1, What a brown-noser! 
-1, I'm sorry I am so late. 
0, What happened?
-1, I was stuck in traffic. There was a big accident. 
-1, I hope no one was injured. 
0, I saw a few ambulances.
-1, That's terrible. 
-1, This hotel is so old. 
0, It's not that bad.
-1, What do you mean? This place is awful. 
-1, I have seen worse hotels. Stop complaining. 
-1, There is a bug in my bed. 
-1, Ok. This place is pretty bad. 
0, Are you working late again?
0, Yes. My boss asked me to finish this project one week early.
-1, That's a tight deadline. 
0, I know. I have other deadlines to meet too.
0, Do you need help with the project?
0, No. I'll just work all weekend.
0, How's your diet going?
-1, Not well. 
0, What's wrong?
-1," I can't eat sugar but, I love things with sugar. "
0," So, you're on the no-sugar diet?"
-1, Yeah. It's torture. 
-1, I tried that once. It was hard. 
0, How did you lose weight last year?
0, I did the no-fat diet and exercise.
0, What is a no-fat diet?
-1," You can't eat things like fried foods, butter, or ice cream. "
-1, That sounds worse than the no-sugar diet. 
-1, It is worse. 
0, How is the negotiation going?
-1, Not well. NAME is a tough negotiator. 
0, What's the problem?
-1, He doesn't want to compromise on anything. 
0, What are you going to do if you can't reach a deal?
0, I'm going to walk away. He's not the only tough person in the room.
0, Do you want to go to the concert tonight?
0, Do you have tickets?
1, Yes! I got two tickets from my boss.
1," I would love to go, but what about NAME?"
0, I only have two tickets.
-1, What if she finds out? She'll be so sad. 
1, I can't give up these tickets. They're front row seats!
1, Front row!
0, Don't you want to buy a concert T-shirt?
0, Then she'll know we went to the concert.
0, We'll get her one and tell her that my boss got them for us.
1, Ok. That's a good lie.
0," Hello, this is NAME."
0," Hi, NAME. NAME here. How many smoke detectors are in your apartment?"
0," Actually, I have two."
0, Are the batteries fresh?
1, Both batteries are good.
1, Great. I need to come by and check them myself.
1," No problem, when are you coming by?"
0, Thursday at noon. I'll let myself in if you're not there.
1," Okay, remember to lock my door when you leave."
1, I'll be in and out of there in just a few minutes.
0, Do you ever go home?
0, I have so much work to do.
-1, Do you stay late at work every day? 
0," Yeah, almost every day."
-1, You're becoming a workaholic. 
-1, I know. My wife is not happy about it. 
0," Hey B, do you want to join us for lunch?"
-1, No. I have to work. 
0, What about drinks after work?
-1, No. I'm staying late tonight. 
0, Don't you stay late every night?
0, Yeah. I need to get some things done.
-1, You work too much. 
0, That's what my wife says.
-1, Don't you think that's a problem? 
0, Yeah. Tonight's our wedding anniversary too.
-1, You'd better go home! 
0, Our company is going through an acquisition.
0, What is that?
0, When a company buys another company.
0, Why is this happening?
-1, We can't compete with the bigger company. 
0, Wow! When is the acquisition happening?
0, At the end of this year.
0, That's soon.
0, I know.
0, Are you worried?
-1, Yes! That's how my brother lost his job. 
-1, That sucks. 
-1, I better start looking for a new job. 
0, If I need help with the computer after I take it home who should I call?
0, Please call us. We offer after sales service.
0, What is that?
1, We are here to help and support you with your new product after you leave the store.
0, Is there an extra charge for this service?
1," No, not at all. If you need help with installation or operation, please call our store any time."
0," Mom, can we have a picnic this afternoon?"
0," Sure, NAME. Where should we have it?"
0, How about the lake?
1, That's a great idea!
0, What should we pack for lunch?
0, I can make ham sandwiches and potato salad.
1, Yummy. I love ham sandwiches and potato salad.
0, Tell your sisters about the picnic.
0, Ok. I think it is going to get hot later today.
1, That's good. It will be a good day for a swim in the lake.
0, I'll tell NAME and NAME to wear their swimsuits.
0, Don't forget to pack your life jackets too.
0, Ok. Will NAME be joining us?
1," Of course, your brother will be joining us."
0, Where's NAME?
-1, He's late. 
-1, Again? He's late for work almost every day. 
-1, I know. He says he has car troubles. 
-1, Is it his brakes again? 
-1, No. This time it's the transmission. 
0, Did you see that?
1, Yes. It was an amazing magic trick.
1, It looked so real.
0," It did, but it was just magic."
0, Are you sure?
1, Yes.
-1, You stole money from her purse. 
-1," No, I did not. "
0, I saw you do it.
-1, Are you calling me a liar? 
-1, Yes! You are lying about stealing. 
-1, You have no proof. 
0, Have you met the new intern?
1, Yes. She's very enthusiastic.
-1, I know. I don't trust her. 
1, Why? She is just ambitious.
-1, I think she wants my job. 
-1, I think you're being paranoid. 
-1, NAME is really mad at you. 
0, Why?
-1, You were late for work and she needed a report. 
0, I called this morning and left a message with the receptionist.
-1, You did? I don't think the receptionist told NAME. 
0, Are you serious?
-1, Yeah. NAME is really angry. She needed that report for her meeting with the president. 
0, I asked the receptionist to print my report and give it to NAME.
0, You had better tell NAME.
0, I'm going to talk to the receptionist first.
0," Hello, this is NAME."
0," Hello, NAME. This is NAME. How many smoke detectors are on your ceiling?"
0, I have two smoke detectors.
0, Do you have fresh batteries in both of them?
1, Both batteries are pretty fresh.
1, Very good. I have to come by there and check out all the detectors.
1," Very good, when do you think you'll be coming over?"
0, I'll be by on Thursday at noon. You don't have to be there.
0," I won't be home. Just remember to lock my door, okay?"
1, You won't even know that I've been there.
0, What's on the news?
-1, Someone just broke out of prison. 
0, Where?
0, A few miles from here.
-1, Don't open the door for anyone. 
1, I know. I'm glad we have a big dog.
-1," If he starts barking, I'm grabbing my gun. "
0, Be careful with that thing.
1, I'm always careful and prepared.
-1, I hope the police catch him soon. 
0, So is the rumor true?
0, What rumor?
0, That you're leaving the company.
0, Where did you hear that?
0, Everyone is talking about it.
-1, Excuse me for minute. I need to go to the restroom. 
0, Can I help you?
0, I want to speak with the manager.
0, Is there a problem?
-1, Yes! These shoes do not fit. 
0, Do you have the receipt?
0, Yes. I want a refund.
-1, This was a sale item. We do not give refunds on sale items. 
-1, I didn't know that. 
-1," I'm sorry, but that is our store policy. "
-1, I am calling my lawyer! 
0, May I help you?
0, I need to buy my wife an anniversary gift.
0, When is your anniversary?
-1, It was yesterday! 
0, Oh dear. How about these diamond earrings?
1, Perfect. I will take them.
1, Hi NAME. Why do you look so excited?
0, Hi NAME. NAME and I are taking a trip to the Bahamas.
1, That's wonderful. Is it a special occasion?
0, It's was our anniversary yesterday.
1, Happy anniversary! How many years have you been married?
0, 30 years.
1, That's wonderful.
1, Thanks. We've been planning this trip for years. But he surprised me with the tickets last night.
1, That's so sweet. When do you leave?
1, We're leaving in a couple of weeks. I can't wait. This is the best anniversary present.
0, Are you and NAME free tonight?
0, Yes. Why?
1, Would you like to come over? I'd like to make you both dinner since I missed your anniversary yesterday.
1, Sure. That's so kind of you.
-1, NAME is driving me crazy! 
0, Why?
-1, He has an annoying habit of tapping his fingernails on the desk. 
0, Have you told him to stop?
-1, No. I don't want to be rude. 
0," Well, if it's making you crazy, you need to tell him."
0, I think the managers are discussing our annual raises.
-1, Don't get your hopes too high. 
0, Why?
-1, Business has not been good lately. 
1, Employees still deserve raises. We work hard.
-1, Probably not hard enough to our managers. 
0," During my review, my boss asked me what my goals are."
0, What did you say?
-1, I told her I didn't know. 
-1, That's not a very good answer. 
-1, I know. She probably thinks I have no goals for my future. 
0, I thought you had plans to go back to school and get a degree.
0, That is my plan.
0, I thought you wanted a degree so you can apply for better paying positions in the company.
1, You're right.
-1, Then why didn't you tell her these things? 
-1, I got nervous and couldn't talk. 
-1, Hmmm... 
-1," Hey NAME, why do you look so worried? "
-1," Oh, hi NAME. NAME and I had a big argument and she has decided to move out. "
0, What did you argue about?
0, I told her that she needs to help clean up around the apartment.
0, What happened after you told her that?
-1, She got upset and said she is moving out. But it's the truth. She never helps around house. 
-1," Yeah, that could be a problem. "
-1, I had to say something since we're roommates and I'm tired of cleaning her mess. 
1, I totally understand. I like things neat and organized too.
-1, But the bigger problem is that she never pays her rent on time. She is late every month. 
0, What are you going to do?
-1, I need to find a roommate soon. I can't afford the rent by myself. Do you know anyone looking for a roommate? 
1," Yes, I do."
0, Who?
0, Me.
1, That would be awesome!
1," B, we're excited to start working with you."
0, Should we set up a meeting to discuss the details of the work?
1, Yes. That's a good idea.
0, When are you free?
0, How about next Tuesday?
0, I have an all day meeting on Tuesday. What about Wednesday?
0, I'm on a business trip on Wednesday. I will be back Friday morning.
0, Friday works for me. Should we do a lunch meeting?
0, I'll put it in my calendar.
0, See you.
0," Hello, NAME speaking."
0," Hey, NAME. This is NAME. Tell me how many smoke detectors you have, please."
0," This apartment came with one, and I installed another one."
0, Are there fresh batteries in each of them?
1, Each detector beeps when the battery is low. They're not beeping.
1, Good. I'm calling all the tenants because I have to check all the detectors.
1," Okay, What day were you thinking about dropping by?"
0," I'll be at your building at noon on Thursday. If you're not there, I'll let myself in."
1," If you're thirsty, you can grab a beer or soda out of my frig."
1," Thanks, but it'll only take me about two minutes to test them and leave."
0, I need help with negotiating.
0, What do you want to negotiate?
0, I want to change some of the terms in a contract.
1," First of all, don't be afraid to ask for what you want."
0, What else?
1, Be willing to say no if you're not happy.
0, How are the kids doing?
0, They are so busy with sports.
0, What do they play?
0, NAME plays softball and NAME plays baseball.
0, You must be busy with games.
0, There are games every weekend.
0, Isn't it fun to watch?
1, It is so much fun to watch and cheer the teams on.
0, What was the boss talking about?
-1, Weren't you listening? 
-1," Yes. But, I didn't quite understand what he meant. "
-1, He said no one is getting a raise this year. 
-1, That's ridiculous. 
1, I know. The managers are all getting bonuses.
1, The company made a profit too.
-1, I don't know what's going on. 
0, I'm going to ask for a clear explanation.
-1, Good luck. You may lose your job. 
0," Dad, can we get a dog?"
0," NAME, are we talking about this again?"
0, You promised we could get one when I got older.
1, Having a dog is a big responsibility.
1, I know. I promise to help take care of it.
0," You have to walk him, feed him, bathe him, clean his messes, and play with him."
1, I promise to do all of those things.
0, I need to talk to your mom first.
-1, But mom doesn't want a dog. She doesn't like them. 
-1, It's because she is afraid of them. 
-1, Why is she afraid of dogs? 
-1, She was bitten by a dog when she was a child. 
0," Oh, I see. But if we get a puppy, we can train it not to bite."
1, That's true.
0," Hey NAME, I'm thinking about asking the boss for a promotion."
1," NAME, you definitely deserve a promotion. You are too qualified for this job."
0, Really? You think so?
1, You have a lot of experience and you're very good with people. You should be a manager.
-1," That's the position I was going to ask for, but I was worried. "
0, What are you worried about?
-1, I don't have a college degree. You have to have a college degree for that position. 
1, But you have lots of experience. You have more experience than some of the current managers.
0," I know, but degrees are important too."
0, I know they are. Did you ever think about going back to school and getting your degree?
-1," I have, but I am so busy these days. I don't have time to work and study. "
1, I understand.
-1," I'm not married yet, but I take care of my elderly parents. "
0, That's a lot of work too.
-1," Hey NAME, why do you look so nervous? "
0, I'm going to ask the boss for a raise.
1, You should. You deserve a raise. You work very hard.
1, I do work hard. I'm here early every day and I leave late every night.
1," Yeah, you do. You also help other people when they need help. You've helped me many times."
0," Also, I've been here for 10 years. My last raise was three years ago."
1, Three years? Then I think it's definitely time for a raise.
0, Do you think she will say yes?
1, I think she will. She is nice. She listens well and she is also very fair.
0, I wrote a short report about why I deserve a raise.
1, Only you would do that. You are so detail-oriented.
1, I like to be prepared about everything.
1, That's another reason why you should get a raise.
0, I need a vacation.
0, What's wrong?
-1," This job is so stressful, NAME! "
0, I think you should ask the boss for some time off?
-1, I can't right now. I have a big presentation on Friday. 
0, Take a break next week after the presentation.
0, I have another project after this one.
-1, You need to make a change. You're going to get sick. 
-1, I know. But I have a lot of responsibilities. 
0, I know you do. But you also have to take care of yourself too.
0, You're right. I need to talk to the boss and tell him that I need a vacation. Do you think he will understand?
-1, I think so. He had a heart attack a few years ago. He understands that health is very important. 
1, Ok. I will talk to him today. Thanks for your advice.
0, You're welcome. Where do you plan to go on vacation?
1," A nice, warm beach."
1, That sounds great!
0, Would you like to go out to dinner this Saturday?
0, I already have plans.
0, What about next Saturday?
0, I have plans next Saturday too.
-1, You have a busy schedule. 
0," Yes, I do."
0, Hi NAME. What are you doing here?
0, Hi NAME. I'm here for a check up. How about you?
0, I'm here for a procedure.
0, What kind of procedure?
0, A root canal.
-1," A root canal? That's pretty serious, isn't it? "
-1, Yeah. I didn't take care of a tooth and now it's infected. 
-1, Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you in pain? 
-1, A little. I took some medicine this morning. 
1, That should help.
-1," I don't have dental insurance, so it's going to be very expensive. "
-1, That's terrible. Why don't you have dental insurance? 
-1, I didn't think it was important. 
0, Hi. How can I help you?
0, I need to mail this package to Italy.
0, What is in the package?
0, Some toys and baby clothes.
0, Are there any breakables? Is it fragile?
-1, No. 
0, What is the address?
0, I have it here.
0, Please fill out this form. Print clearly.
0, Ok. When will my package arrive?
0, It depends on your shipping choice.
1, I would like your fastest shipping.
0, It will be there in one week.
1, Great! That's perfect.
0," Hi, this is NAME."
0," Hi, NAME. It's NAME. I need to know how many smoke detectors are in your apartment."
0, There was one when I moved in. Then I added one.
0, Do both detectors have fresh batteries?
0, I always keep them fresh. I don't want to burn to death.
1, That's good. I have to come by there and check out all of the detectors.
1, Not a problem. When will you be here?
0, I'll be letting myself into all the apartments on Thursday at noon.
0," If it's raining, make sure you wipe your feet before you come inside, okay?"
1, Not to worry. I'll be in and out of your place in a flash.
0, Our new client is having a party at his house.
0, Are you going?
-1, No. I don't like him. 
0, Why?
-1, He makes inappropriate comments. 
0, What kind of comments?
-1, Rude comments about people. 
0, Why is our company working with him then?
0, He's our boss's friend.
-1, Our boss is wimp. 
0, Hey NAME. Is that a new car?
0," Hey NAME. No, this is a rental car."
0, Where is your car?
-1, At the auto shop. I was in an accident yesterday. The car is getting repaired. 
0, Are you ok?
1," Yeah. Luckily, it wasn't a serious accident. There were just some minor damages to the fender and bumper."
1, That's good. When do you get your car back?
0, It's supposed to be ready this afternoon.
1, That's quick.
1," Yeah, my auto shop is pretty fast. They have a lot of mechanics."
1, Do they do a good job? Are they reasonably priced?
1," Oh yes. They do a great job. I haven't had any problems yet. They're a little more expensive than other places, but their work and service is excellent."
0, I may have to get their name and number. My car needs some regular maintenance work.
0," They have a website. Sometimes, they offer discounts on certain services."
0, How's the presentation going?
1, Good.
0, Can you give us some information about it?
-1, I don't have time. I need to make a phone call. 
-1, Ok. You look like you're in a hurry. 
-1, It's important. It can't wait. 
0, Hey NAME. Are you free for dinner tonight?
-1," Hi NAME. No, I'm not. I'm babysitting a neighbor's kid. "
0, What time?
0, From 5 pm to 9 pm.
0, What about next Friday?
0, I'm babysitting again next Friday.
-1, Why are you babysitting so much? 
1, It's a good way to make money.
0, Do you like children?
1," Yeah, I love kids. They're fun to play with."
-1, I don't like them. They're noisy and they smell weird. 
-1, You're so funny. You would make a terrible babysitter. 
-1, You're right. I'd rather babysit dogs. 
-1, Dogs are noisy and they smell weird too. 
0, I know.
-1, You're silly. 
0, I think the company has finally made a profit.
1, That's great news!
1, We're all getting raises and bonuses this year.
1, That makes me very happy.
-1, Me too. We haven't had raises in four years. 
-1, We've never had bonuses. 
1, That's right!
1," If the company is doing well financially, we should definitely receive some benefits."
1, I agree. We work really hard.
1, Let's celebrate over drinks after work.
0, Hi NAME. What are you doing today?
1, Hi NAME. I'm going back-to-school shopping with the kids.
0, We did that last week.
0, Are there any good sales going on?
1," Yeah, the mall is having great sales."
1, Good. I need to buy clothes and shoes for my daughter. She has outgrown all of her clothes.
0, Really? My kids are still wearing the same size.
0, NAME grew four inches during the summer.
1, Wow! That's amazing!
1, I know. She eats a lot these days.
0," Probably because she is growing. Do you need to buy school supplies, too?"
0," Yeah, I will be shopping for clothes, shoes, and school supplies today."
1, I'm glad I'm done. The mall was really crowded last week. I think everyone is shopping for school.
-1, I do not like crowds. 
1, Good luck! I hope you find everything you need.
1, Thanks. It's going to be a long day.
0, Hi NAME.
0, Hi NAME.
0," NAME, would you like to come to a backyard barbeque?"
0, Sure. When?
0, Tomorrow at 5 o'clock PM.
0, Who else is coming?
0, I invited a few other neighbors.
0, What's the occasion?
1, I got a new outdoor grill and I want to test it out.
1, It sounds like fun. What can I bring?
0, Would you like to bring some beverages?
1, I can do that.
1, Great! I'm going to grill some hamburgers and hot dogs.
1, That sounds delicious!
0," Our neighbor, NAME, is going to bring some apple pies."
1, This is going to be a great party.
1, I hope so. I hope my grill works well.
0, Hi NAME.
0, Hi NAME.
0, I'm thinking about throwing NAME a birthday party in the backyard.
1, That sounds like a great idea. Have you checked the weather?
1, The weather is going to be sunny this weekend.
1, That's perfect for an outdoor party.
1, I want to do a barbeque and have games.
1, I can help you.
1, That would be wonderful.
0, Have you thought of what you want to serve?
1, I want to do something simple like grill hot dogs with potato chips.
0, I can bake a cake for you.
1, Wow! That is so kind of you. Are you sure?
1, It would be my pleasure.
0, How was the hotel?
-1, It was awful. We had to switch rooms a couple of times. 
0, Why?
-1," Well, we found bugs in the carpet in one room. We had already unpacked. So, we had to re-pack everything and ask for another room. "
0, What was wrong with the second room?
-1, We paid for a garden room and it was a view of the parking lot. 
-1, That's terrible. Did you finally get a good room? 
0," They were out of garden view rooms, so they upgraded us to an ocean view room."
-1," That's nice! So, why was it so awful? "
-1, Our next door neighbor snored so loudly. He kept us awake every night. 
0, Did you ask for another room?
-1," Yes, but they said that there were no more rooms available. "
-1, I'm sorry you had a terrible time. 
1, That's ok. The manager was really nice about it. He offered us a free stay next time.
0, Are you going to go back there?
1, Of course. It'll be free.
0," Hey NAME, have you seen NAME lately?"
0, Didn't you hear the news?
0, No. What happened?
-1, He got into a car accident last week. 
0, Is he ok?
-1, No. He's in the hospital. He broke both of his legs and ribs. He also has a head injury. 
-1," That's terrible. I had the flu, so I haven't seen or talked to anyone lately. How's NAME? "
0, NAME has come home a couple of times to get a change of clothes.
-1, She must be devastated. 
-1, She is a very worried wife. 
0, Have you seen him?
-1, NAME and I visited him in the hospital a couple of days ago. He is on so much medication. 
-1, Wow! That's serious. 
0, Yeah.
0," Hi, this is NAME."
0," Hi, NAME. It's NAME. Can you tell me how many smoke detectors you have?"
0, There are two smoke detectors in my apartment.
0, Do you know how new the batteries are?
0, I'm very afraid of fires. I change the batteries every Labor Day.
1, Good. I'm calling all the tenants before I come by to test the detectors.
0, My detectors are ready for you. When will you be visiting?
0, This Thursday at noon. But you don't have to be there.
0," Okay, just pardon the mess when you come in."
1, You'll never even know that I was there.
-1, The traffic is really getting bad these days. 
-1, I agree. I sat in traffic for two hours last night. 
-1, I've started to leave work late just to beat rush hour traffic. 
-1, I wish I could do that. I have to pick up my son before the daycare closes. 
0," Oh, I see. What time does the daycare close?"
0, 6 o'clock.
0, What time do you usually get there?
0, Just a few minutes before they close.
0, What happens if you're late?
-1," They will wait with the child, of course. But you have to pay extra. "
0, Have you ever been late?
-1," Yeah, a few times. I was late yesterday. I don't want to pay extra. Daycare is already expensive. "
0," Yeah, I'm sure it is. Do you have other people who can help you?"
-1," No, I just listen to the traffic report and leave earlier if the roads sound bad. "
0, Is your boss understanding?
1," Yeah, she's very understanding. She has children too."
-1, There was a bank robbery downtown. 
0, Did anyone get hurt?
-1, I don't know yet. 
0, Have they caught the robbers?
-1," No, the police are looking for them. "
-1, We better lock our doors. 
0, How are you doing today?
1, Great. Thanks.
0, What can I help you with?
1, I would like to open a bank account.
0, What kind would you like to open?
0, I need a checking account.
0, Would you also like to open a savings account?

-1, I can't find my mailbox key. 
0, Is that all? That's a lot better than losing your car keys.
-1," I had a duplicate, but I can't find it either. "
1," If you come by my place, I can loan you a key."
-1, There's no emergency. All I get is junk mail and bills. 
0, Can you wait till Wednesday? I'll make you two more keys.
1," Sure, that'll be fine."

1, I'll bring my telescope.
0, What are you going to do on your business trip?
-1, I'm not sure. 
0, What's the schedule?
-1, I don't know. Our clients haven't sent me anything yet. 
1, You're having a good attitude about it.
1, I know. I'm trying to be flexible.
0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is NAME.
-1, Hi NAME. Where have you been? You haven't been in school for a week. 
-1, I've been really sick. I had the flu. 
0, Are you feeling better now?
1, Yeah. I feel much better. I am going back to school on Monday.
1, That's good! We all missed you.
0, Thanks. Did I miss a lot of school work?
0, Yeah. We had homework every night and we have a test next Friday.
-1, Oh no. That makes me worry. 
0, Talk to the teacher. She will understand.
-1, I hope so. She is a very strict. 
1, Would you like to borrow my notes from class? I can make copies of them and bring them to you.
1, That would be great! I can study them this weekend.
1, That's a good idea. But don't try to finish everything over the weekend.
-1, I know. I might get sick again! 
1, I'll see you around 4 pm.
1, Ok. Thank you!
1, My mother makes the best meatballs.
0, Why are they the best?
1, They are very moist and tasty.
0, Does she put a special ingredient inside?

1, Ok. I can't wait to try her recipe.
0, Hi NAME. What's wrong?
-1, Oh hi NAME. I just got back from the hospital. 
-1, Is something wrong? 
-1, My son was in an auto accident last night. 
-1, Oh dear. I'm sorry to hear that. Was he seriously injured? 
-1, Yes. He broke both of his legs and his ribs. 
-1, That's awful! 
0, I know. He just got his driver's license a month ago.
-1, How scary for him. 
-1, It wasn't his fault though. He was hit by a drunk driver. 
-1, That's terrible! 
-1, I'm so angry about it! My son could have been killed by an irresponsible driver. 
-1, You're right! Did they catch the other driver? Was he or she injured? 
-1," Yeah, he was arrested. He wasn't injured. "
0," Good afternoon, NAME. This is NAME."
0," Oh, hi, NAME. How can I help you?"
0, I'm going to be moving out.

0, I'll be leaving on the last day of June.
0, Any particular reason?
0, I got a new job.
1, Congratulations! What is it?
0, I'm going to be an ESL instructor at Pasadena City College.
1," Great! By the way, what's ESL?"
0, ESL stands for English as a Second Language.
1," Well, I'm glad it wasn't your neighbors causing you to move."
0, Just because they play their TV loud enough for the whole complex?
0," Yes, I know. I'm going to have another talk with them."
1," Anyway, it's been nice knowing you for these past few years."
1," You, too. Keep in touch, and good luck with your new job."
0, Did you watch the news this morning?
0, No. What happened?
-1, There was a chemical explosion at my old office. 
-1, Did anyone get hurt? 
-1, I don't know yet. 
1, You're lucky you don't work there anymore.
-1, I know. The building was so old. 
0, Did they evacuate the area?
0, Yeah. The police and fire department are still there.
0, I should call my friend. She lives a couple of blocks from there.
-1, Hey NAME. Are you working late again? 
0," Yeah, NAME. I have a big project I'm working on."
0, How's it going?
-1, Not well. We keep running into problems with the client. 
0, What kind of problems?
-1, The client either doesn't like our designs or keeps changing his mind. It's very frustrating. 
-1, That can be very annoying. 
-1," It is. So, my group has to start over each time. It's such a waste of time and money. "
0, When is the deadline?
-1, In two weeks. I don't know how we're going to make it. 
0, Where's the rest of your group?
0, They went to eat. I told them to go. They're going to bring me back some dinner.
0, Hi NAME. What are you doing?
0, Hi NAME. I'm planning a birthday party for NAME.
0, How is that going?
-1, Not well. I can't think of anything to do. 
0, How many kids do you want to invite?
0, He wants to invite all of the boys in his classroom. That's 12 boys.
-1, No girls? 
-1, He doesn't want to invite any girls. 
0, How about an outdoor party?
-1, We did that last year and it rained. 
-1, Oh. That's not fun. 
0, I was thinking about taking the kids to a pizza place.
1," Kids like pizza. How about taking them to a movie theater, too?"
-1, That's too expensive. 
0, Yeah. How about renting a movie and watching it at home after the pizza place?
1, I love that idea! Then they can play in our backyard if it doesn't rain.
1, That sounds like a great party.
1, Thanks for your help.
0, Today is my mom's birthday.
0, What are you going to get her?
0, Flowers and a card.
0, What about that new handbag she wants?

0, I can loan you some money.
-1," No, I don't want to borrow money. "
0, Hi NAME. Who are the presents for?
0," Hi NAME. My son, NAME. Today is his birthday."
0, How old is NAME now?
0, 12 years old.
0, He's almost a teenager.
1, I know. He is growing up so fast.
0, Are you doing anything special?
1," Yeah, he is having a birthday party with his friends. Then afterwards, we're meeting my parents for dinner. They want to take him out to a nice restaurant."
1, What a fun day for him.
0, I hope so. We wanted to invite his friends over and have a pizza party.
0, Then he's going to eat again after the party?
1," Yeah, he can eat a lot these days. He's a growing boy."
0, Did you make a birthday cake?
-1," No, I bought one this time. I didn't have time to bake it this year. "
1, Don't forget the candles.
-1, Oh no. I forgot to buy some and I don't have time to go to the store. The birthday guests are coming soon. 
1, I have a brand new pack. There are 12 candles in the box. You can have them.
1, Perfect! Thank you!
-1, The boss was not happy with our presentation. 
-1, I don't know what happened. 
-1, You weren't ready. 
-1, Are you blaming me? 
-1, Yes! You were not organized during the presentation. 
-1, I knew you would blame me. 
0," Mom, do I have to go to the family reunion?"
-1," Yes, NAME. Why don't you want to go? "
-1, It's boring and I have no one to talk to. 
0, You have a lot of cousins.
0," I know, but they are all younger than me."
1," So, you could entertain them."
1, Ok.
-1, Your grandparents will be very disappointed if you do not attend. 
0, Ok. Where is it going to be?
1, It is going to be at an Italian restaurant. Italian food is your favorite.
0, I know. How long is it going to be?
0, Probably a few hours.
0, Can I leave early?
0," If you can find a ride home, you can leave early."

-1, $500? That's a lot of money. Why do you need so much? 
0, I need to pay the rent.
-1, I don't have that much. 
0, Hello?
0, NAME. This is NAME. Do you have a lantern I can borrow?
0, I think so. I have to check.
-1, Our lantern is broken. 
0, What do you need a lantern for?
0, We are going camping this weekend.
0, We went camping last month.
0, How was the weather last month?
1, It was great! Sunny all weekend.
0, I think it is going to rain this weekend.
-1, That's not good. Why are you going camping if it's going to rain? 
1, The kids still want to go.
1, I'm sure you will still have fun.
0, I hope so. We're going to pack some extra clothes.
0, Let me check on that lantern.
0, Sure.
0, Did you hear the news? NAME is retiring.
0, Why?
-1, He's sick. He needs to stop working to take care of his health. 
-1, That's so sad. 
-1, I know! I'm going to miss him. 
0, When is his last day?
0, Next Friday.
0, That soon?
-1, Yeah. I heard his doctor told him to retire immediately. 
1, Wow! He's been at the company for 20 years.
0, That's a long time.
0, Is anyone going to throw him a retirement party?
-1, I don't know. 
0," If no one is, we should throw him one."
1, That's a good idea. Let's talk to the other employees and plan it.
0, Do you know who is taking his place?
0, I heard it was going to be NAME.
0, NAME? Is he qualified for that position?
-1, I don't know. People are not going to be happy. 
-1, I'm not happy. 
0," How's it going, NAME? This is NAME."
0," Hello, NAME. What's up?"
0, I wanted to let you know that I have to move out.
-1, I'm sorry to hear that. When are you moving? 
0, The thirtieth of June.
0, May I ask why you're leaving?

1, Good for you! What's your new job?
0, I am an ESL teacher at Pasadena City College.
1, Very good! What does ESL mean?
0, ESL means English as a Second Language.
1," Well, I'm glad you're not moving because of your neighbors."
1, I can't tell you how happy I'll be not to have to listen to their TV.
0," Yes, I'm going to tell them one more time to turn down their TV and keep it down."
1, You've been a good apartment manager and a good person. I'll see you in June.
1, Thank you. I hope your new job and new apartment are good for you.
0," Hey NAME, do you want to try the new diner down the street?"
1, Sure. I hear they have really good food especially their omelets.
1, NAME went their last weekend and said it was the best breakfast place in town.
0," Yeah, I heard the same thing from NAME. She waited an hour for a table."
-1, I don't think I can wait an hour. I'm hungry right now. 
0, Do you want to make breakfast at home?
0, Ok. What do you want to eat?
1, I'd like a ham and cheese omelet.
1, That sounds good. Do we have all of the ingredients?
0," Well, we only need eggs, ham, and cheese."
-1, I think we may be out of ham. I used the last few slices for a sandwich yesterday. 
0, Ok. How about a vegetable omelet?
1," That's good too. We have green peppers, mushrooms, and onions."
1, That's perfect.
1, Great! I'll brew some coffee and you make the omelet.
-1, I don't know how to make an omelet. 
-1," You don't? Well, I don't either. "
0, Let's just go to the new diner.
1, That sounds like a better plan.
0," NAME, can you help me with breakfast?"
0," Sure, Mom? Is someone coming over this morning?"
0, Your grandparents are coming.
1," Oh, how nice. What are we making?"
0," Pancakes, eggs, bacon, and hash browns."
1, Yummy! That sounds delicious.
0, I hope so. Your grandfather has a big appetite. I hope there's enough food.
0," Mom, you always make too much food. It looks like a breakfast buffet every time they come over."
1, I want to make sure there is enough food. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
0, Should I make freshly-squeezed orange juice?
1, That would be great. Do you know where the juicer is?
0," Yeah, it's on the top shelf of the pantry."
-1, Oh no! 
0," What's wrong, Mom?"
0, I'm all out of eggs. Tell your Dad to go to the store and buy some eggs. I'll start on the bacon and hash browns.
0, Dad! Mom needs you to buy some eggs!
0, Hi NAME. Is NAME home from school?
0," Yeah, we just got back from the hospital."
0, What happened?
-1, NAME fell at school and broke his arm. 
-1, Are you serious? That's terrible! 
0," Yeah, the school called an ambulance and they took him to the hospital."
-1, Wow! Is he in a lot of pain? 
0, Just a little. The doctor gave him some pain medication.
1, That's good.
-1, He's so upset though. 
0, Because of the pain?
0, No. His soccer team is playing the championship game this weekend and he's the goalie.
-1, That must really hurt more than the arm. 
0, I think it does. He's been practicing so much for this game.
0, Is he going to go to the game?
0, Of course. He has to go and cheer his team on.
-1, Something is wrong with my computer. 
0, What is wrong with it?

0, Are you positive?
0, I always catch this bus.
0, How long is this bus ride?
0, It only takes half an hour.
0, Where do we get off at?

1, That's convenient.
1, Absolutely.
-1," I need to get on another bus, but I have no more money. "
0, Where'd the rest of your money for the bus go?
0, I spent it on a bag of chips.
1," Well, that was an intelligent thing to do."
-1, You don't have any spare change? 
-1," No, I don't. "
0, How am I going to get home?
0, You should just ask the bus driver for a transfer.
0, How much does that cost?
1," It's free, just go ask for one."
1, Thanks for letting me know.
1," No problem, just go ask."
-1," I'm broke, and I have to catch another bus. "
0, Why don't you have any money for another bus?
0, I got hungry and bought some chips.
1, That was smart.
0, Do you have any change I can use for the bus?
-1, I don't have any. 
-1, I don't know how I'm going to get home. 
0, Get a transfer from the bus driver.
0, How much is a transfer?

1, Good for you! What does ESL stand for?
0, ESL is English as a Second Language.
1," Well, I'm glad you don't feel you're being chased out by your neighbors."
-1, Their TV is so loud you'd think they were stone deaf. 
-1, I'll tell them one more time to turn down their TV. Then I'm going to evict them. 
1, Thanks for all your help over the past few years.
1, Thanks. Good luck with your new neighbors and your new job.
-1," I don't have any more cash, and I have to get on another bus to get home. "
-1, Why don't you have any more money? 
0," I wanted some chips at lunch today, so I spent it."
1, That was a bright idea.
0, Do you have some change I can borrow?
-1, I don't have any change for you. 
0, I need to get home.
0, Why don't you just ask the bus driver for a transfer?
-1, I don't have money for a transfer. 
0, Where is the bus?
-1, I think it's running late. 
-1, It should've been here 30 minutes ago. 
0, It should be coming soon.
-1," It better, because I'm already late for work. "
-1, I can't stand riding the bus. 
-1," Me too, it's so unreliable. "
1, That is true.
-1, It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather. 
-1, Exactly. That's the worst part. 
0, When is the bus going to get here?
-1, It's obviously late. 
0, It was scheduled to be here about thirty minutes ago.
1, I'm sure it'll be here in a little bit.
-1," I hope so, because I'm running really late for work. "
-1, I hate having to take the bus every day. 
-1," So do I, you can never count on public transportation. "
1, Exactly.
-1, I really can't stand being at the bus stop in the heat and rain. 
0, I know what you mean.
0, I want to get on the bus already.
-1, It just isn't on time today. 
-1, It was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago. 
1, I think it'll be here pretty soon.
0," I need to get to work, so it better."
-1, I really do hate public transportation. 
-1," I agree, it's just never on time. "
1, That's right.
-1, I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather. 
-1," Oh, that's the worst. "
0, Is this our bus stop?
0, I think this is it. Get off.
0," Dude, where are we at?"
-1, I have no idea. 
-1, I thought this was the right stop! 
-1, It doesn't look right to me. 
0, Did you make us get off early?
1, I think we did.
-1, I should not have listened to you. 
-1, I really thought this was our stop. 
-1," I'm not sure, is this our stop? "
0," Yeah, get off the bus."
0, Do you have any idea where we are?
-1, I'm really not sure. 
-1, This can't be the right stop. 
-1, I don't think this is right. 
-1," We got off too early, didn't we? "
-1," Yeah, we did get off too early. "
0, I should've just stayed on the bus.
-1, I messed up. 
0, Are we supposed to get off right here?
0," I think so, get off."
0, Where are we?
-1, I don't know. 
1, You said this was the right stop.
-1, I think I was wrong. 
0, Did we get off the bus too early?
-1, I don't know; it kind of looks like we did. 
-1, Why did you tell me to get off? 
-1, I'm sorry. I thought this was our stop. 
-1, I really don't feel like walking. 
0, We could always wait for the next bus to come.

0," No, not anything new. But I just found out that I've been hired for a new job."
1, Great! What is the new job?
0, I'm going to be an ESL instructor at Pasadena City College.
1, That's great! ESL is some kind of electronics class?
0, ESL is a class for students who are learning English as their second language.
1, I'm glad that your neighbors aren't the reason that you're moving.
-1, I won't miss having to listen to their darn TV. 
-1, I'm giving them one more warning about their TV. Then they're out of there. 
1, I appreciate what a good apartment manager you've been these past few years.
1," It's been nice knowing you, too. Good luck teaching LES."
0, Where do we get off at?
0, I think we have a little ways to go.

1, That's true.
-1, Are you sure we weren't supposed to get off already? 
-1, I don't know. 
-1, I thought you knew where we get off at.

-1, Seriously? 
-1," Yeah, we definitely missed our stop. "
-1, That's the last time I get on a bus with you. 
-1, My bad. 
0," So, where is this bus supposed to take us?"

-1," That's true, and we have been on this bus for a while. "
0, Read one of the street signs or something.
-1, Yikes! Temple City. 
-1, That's the last time I'm trusting you with the transportation. 
-1," My bad, but at least we know the right bus to take us back. "
0, Do you even know where this bus is supposed to go?
0, It should take us all the way up to Altadena.

0," Yes, that's right. Next, we will turn on the engine and I will check under the hood to look at the hoses and belts."
0, Should we take the car for a drive?
0," Yes, but before we pull away, let's check to make sure that the radio, turn signals, lights, and seats all work properly."
0, As I am driving what should I be checking?
0, You want to make sure that the brakes don't pull to one side and that the car has good alignment and acceleration.
1, Thanks for your help.
1, You are welcome. Enjoy driving your car!
0, Do you know a place that sells cheap cashmere sweaters?
0, An outlet carries cheap cashmere sweaters.
1, That's a good idea!
1, I've always had good luck at outlets.
1, Thank you for the suggestion.
1, I hope you find a nice sweater.
0, Could you take a few minutes and see if there are any problems with this used car that I am thinking of buying?
1, I am happy to help. Just pull up and we'll give it a good look.
-1, I don't know much about cars. 
0," We need to look inside and outside for signs of an accident or major damage. Also, we need to look for wear on the tires."
0, If I go online I can also check to see if the car has been involved in a major accident.
0," Yes, you can check the history of the car online. Next, we need to turn on the engine and take a look at the belts and hoses."
0, Will you take a drive with me to check handling?
0," A test drive would be good. But first let's make sure that the turn signals, radio, lights, and seats work properly."
0," On a test drive, what should I look for?"
0, We are checking for solid braking and good overall handling.
1, I appreciate you helping me figure out what to look for.
1, My pleasure. This seems to be a solid car and a good choice for you.
0," I want to buy this used car, but I need help figuring out if there are any problems with it."
1, I can help you with that. Drive the car over by the garage and we'll check it out.
0," I know some things to look for, but I know there are other special things to look for."
0, Always start with looking for signs of major damage that may have been repaired and also check tire wear.
0," If the car has been in a major accident, that should have been recorded online."
0," Right. All major accidents should have been recorded. Next start the car up, pop the hood, and we'll take a look at the belts and hoses."
0, I would like for you to take a test drive with me.
0," We'll do that in a minute, but first we should check that the radio, turn signals, and all of the lights work properly."
0," As we drive, what am I checking for?"
0," You want to make sure that the alignment is good, that the engine accelerates smoothly, and that the car can safely brake to a stop."
1, I like knowing what to look for when buying a used car and appreciate the help.
1, This car is in good shape and should give you no major problems. Enjoy it!
-1, I am buying a used car and don't know much about financing it. 
1, I can help you. Do you have a down payment?
0," Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment."
1," Good, because you will not be able to get a loan without putting some money down on the car."
-1, I don't know where exactly to get a loan. 
0," Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot."
0, What is the best choice for financing?
-1, It depends. The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer. 
0, What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?
0," You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car. Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance."
0, Can you help me learn about financing options for a used car?
1, I would love to help you with what I know. I am assuming that you have a down payment.
0," Yes, I already borrowed some money from my parents for the down payment."
0, That will work. A bank or finance company will not loan you money without a down payment.
-1, I am not sure who will loan money to me. 
0," You can apply for a loan at a bank, credit union, or approach the used car dealer who sold you the car. You might also try family and friends."
0, Who offers the best interest rate?
0," A credit union will usually give you the best interest rate, but the dealer will almost always give you some type of loan."
0, Do I need any documents when I apply for a car loan?
0, Be sure that you take a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip. You will have a few days to produce proof of insurance.
-1, I need to go to the DMV and don't know how to make an appointment with them. 
0, First of all you need to figure out if you really need to be there in person. Sometimes you can take care of your business at the Automobile Club or at the DMV website.
0," If I do need to go in, how can I make an appointment?"
0, You can either make an appointment by going online or by calling the phone number listed on their website.
0, What if I just show up there?
-1," If you have all day to wait and a good book to read, that might work for you. "
0, Is the DMV open on Saturdays?
-1," Due to state budget cuts, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays. "
-1, I think that you have just convinced me to join the Automobile Club! 
1," Yes, the Automobile Club takes all the pain out of DMV transactions!"
1, This car is exactly what I want!
1, I am glad that you like it. I've had good experiences with this car.
0," So, how much do you want for the car?"
0," Well, the price in the paper was five thousand dollars."
-1," Yes, I know, but I think that might be a little high for this car. "
0, I might be able to come down a little on the price.
0, How about selling the car for four thousand?
-1," No, that's way less than I could accept. However, I could accept forty-five hundred. "
1, That sounds fair to me.
1, It's a deal then. Thank you!
1, I really love this car!
1, Great! I was hoping that it would go to a driver who appreciates it.
0, How much are you willing to take for the car?
0," As I am sure you noticed, the price on the window is five thousand dollars."
0, Don't you think you could come down a bit on the price?
1, You seem like a nice person. Maybe I could lower the price a bit.
0, Would you sell it to me for four thousand?
0, I am thinking more in the line of four thousand five hundred.
1, I'll take it then!
1, Perfect! That works for both of us.
1, I am definitely interested in buying this car.
1, Wonderful! It's good to find a person who really needs this car.
0, What is the price for this car?
0, The price I listed on eBay was five thousand dollars.
0, I was thinking that maybe you might be willing to lower the price a bit.
1, You know I just got a good deal on my new car. I think I can afford to knock a little off of this car.
1, I was thinking that four thousand would be a good price.
0," I couldn't go that low, but I could sell it for forty-five hundred."
1, That would work well for me.
1, It's done then. I've enjoyed doing business with you.
0, How much does this car cost?
0," Well, come on in and we'll sit down and discuss that right now. How much do you want to pay?"
0, I really was just wondering what the price is.
0," Well, figuring in tax, license, dealer prep, and registration, I can let this car go for fifteen thousand dollars."
0, I was thinking a little lower than that.
0, Whoa! Let's keep talking here. I am sure we can work something out. What price are you thinking is fair?
0, I was thinking more like thirteen thousand dollars.
0," If I want to buy this car, what will it cost me?"
0," Let me get my contract out, and we'll figure that out for you right now."
-1, Can't you just tell me what it costs? 
0," You know, I am prepared to offer you a great deal today on that car. With tax, license, registration, and dealer prep, the total will be fifteen thousand dollars."
-1," Fine, I'll come back later with my father, who is a lawyer, and we can talk then. "
0, I am sure that we can work something out. What price were you thinking would be a good deal for you?
0, Thirteen thousand would be more like it.
-1, Fourteen thousand for this car is a good price. For that I am practically giving it away. 
-1," Normally that would be a good price, but that car has been in an accident. "
0," Yes, I see your point. Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer."
0, I'm looking for a shop that sells inexpensive cashmere sweaters.
0, Have you tried an outlet?
0, Why didn't I think of that?
0, Many of my friends shop at outlets.
1, Thanks. That is a good suggestion.
1, I'm only too happy to help.
1, I really love the look of this car.
0, Would you like to test drive this car?
1," Yes, I would love to take it for a drive."
0," I'll go get the keys, and you can get out your Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."
0, Here's my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
1," Well, just sign this card, and we'll be on our way. Don't forget to buckle your seatbelt!"
0, Can I take it on the freeway to check for acceleration?
1, That would be fine; just don't exceed the speed limit!
1," This car handles great, and I love it!"
1, I am glad that you like this car.
1, The styling of this car really appeals to me.
0, Would you like to take this car for a spin?
1, That would be a great idea.
0," Fine, all I'll need from you is your Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."
0, I've got my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance ready.
1," OK, after you sign this card, we'll take a spin. Make sure you buckle your seatbelt!"
0, I would like to go on the freeway to test it for speed.
1," As long as you don't exceed the speed limit, that would be fine."
1," Whoa, this car has wonderful pickup!"
1," Yes, this is a very popular car."
1," Wow, what a cool car!"
0, How about taking this car out for a drive to see if you like how it handles?
1, I would enjoy seeing how it handles.
0," While I'm getting the keys, you just need to take out your Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."
0, I found my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
1," Great! Sign this card, buckle your seatbelt, and we'll hit the road."
0, I want to take the car up to freeway speed.
1, Take a left at the next signal to enter the freeway. Just keep it under the speed limit!
1," This car has a nice smooth ride, even on the freeway."
1," You know, I've driven it myself, and I agree with you."
0," Now I've decided to buy this car, how do I transfer the title to myself?"
0," Actually, your best bet is to contact the Automobile Club or to go to the DMV website."
0," Basically, what will I need to do?"
0," Both buyer and seller need to transfer the ownership by filling out a Change of Ownership form and signing over the Certificate of Title, which will be either pink or rainbow."
0, Will I have to pay any fees?
0, All of the transfer fees are the responsibility of the buyer.
0, How much will it cost to transfer the title?
0, The DMV has a special formula that they use to calculate the fees. They will figure it out for you.

0, Where do I take my forms?
0, You can take them to the DMV. You have ten days to complete the process.

0, Can you help me figure out how to transfer the title of the car I wish to buy so it will be registered in my name?
1," You can go to the DMV website for information or, if you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can be very helpful."
0, Can you just fill me in on what needs to be done?
0," When you both fill out and sign a Change of Ownership form and sign the Certificate of Title, the ownership will be transferred."
0, Are there any fees involved?
0," As the buyer, you are responsible for all of the fees."
0, How much money will I have to pay to transfer the title?
0," The only way to calculate the fee is to turn your paperwork in to the DMV, and they will figure it out for you."
0, Whom do I give my forms to when they are completed?
0," Check online for special situations, but usually you can mail your forms in to the DMV."
0, Where is the best place to buy a used car?
0," I have always purchased my used cars from an advertisement in the paper, but actually you have many options."
0, Where else could I look for a car?
0," You could look on the Internet. Craigslist is best, as most of the cars listed there are sold locally."
0, What would be best if I wanted to actually go see a lot of used cars that are for sale?
1," The best place is NAME, which is a very large used car lot."
0, Where is NAME?
0, There are many of them. You can look on the Internet or in the phone book for the one closest to you.
0, How about the listings on the college bulletin board?
1," Actually, that is not a bad way to go, especially near the end of a semester as students are moving away."
0, Could you tell me what window I should go to?
0, Do you have an appointment?

0, The DMV windows are set up for different tasks. What are you here to do?
0, I need to transfer ownership of a used car.
0," I can see that you have all of your forms filled out. Drop the forms in that box, and I will call you when your name comes up."
1, Thanks for helping me.
1, You are welcome. May I see your current Driver's License?
0, Here is my license.
1, That's a pretty good picture. Just pay the fee over at the last window and you're done!
-1," This is my first time at the DMV, and I don't know what window to go to. "
0, It depends on what you are doing. Did you make an appointment?
0, I made an appointment last month.
0, All of the windows are for specific services. What do you need to do today?

0, I made my appointment over the Internet.
0, Different windows will be able to help you with different problems. What do you need help with?
0, I need help transferring the ownership of a new car from my friend to myself.
0," The signed forms go in the box, and I will call your name in a few minutes."
1, Thank you for making it seem less confusing.
1," If you would give me your current Driver's License, I will be able to complete the transfer process."
-1," Here is my license, I never really liked that picture! "
1, That is a great picture! Take the forms over to the last window to pay your fees and you're finished!

0, I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you.
0, Would mornings or afternoons be best for you?
1, It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon.
0, It is best if we can go during the week; does that work for you?
0," Because of work, I can only go look at houses on the weekend."
0," Would you like to meet at the real estate office, or should I pick you up at home?"
1," If you could pick me up at home, that would be great."

1, The master suite is the best. Let's go look at that next.
0, Excuse me. Can you help me?
1, Certainly. What can I do for you?
0, I need to purchase a sweater.
0, What is your size?
0, Medium should be fine.
0, Is this one okay?
0, Can I try it on somewhere?
0, The fitting room is in the left corner.
-1, I am not sure I even want to look at this house! 
0, It is a bit of a fixer upper. Let's take a look inside.
-1, It doesn't look much better inside this place. 
0," You know, with a little elbow grease and paint, you could spruce it up a bit."
-1," There are hardly any windows in here, and that makes it really gloomy. "
0, Let's go check out the kitchen. The printout says that it is quite large.
-1, Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper. 
0," Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities. Follow me, please."
0, What's that smell?
0, Perhaps we should move on to the next listing.
-1, This house is not looking all that great from here. 
0, You can't really tell everything about a house from the outside. Let's go inside.
-1, I don't think that it is looking any better inside here. 
1, I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better.
-1, It is just too dark in here with so few windows. 
1, I hear that the kitchen is quite large. Let's go check it out.
-1," The kitchen may be large, but it doesn't have any storage space. "
1, The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant. Maybe it will be a little better.
0, How many dogs live in this house?
0, I think that we have seen all that we need to see here. Let's go look at another house.
-1," From the looks of this house from the outside, I don't really think that I want to go inside. "
0," From here, it does look like it could use a little work. Let's see what the interior looks like."
-1, I am not impressed by the interior of this house. 
0, Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint.
-1," With so few windows, how can you even see what the problems are? "
1, I think that we should check out the kitchen. It is listed as roomy and spacious.
0, Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space?
1, The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite. I think that we should go look at it since we are here.
-1, Is there a dead animal somewhere in here? 
-1," Well, I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house for you. "
-1," I would like to make an offer on this house, but I don't know much about the process. "
0," As your realtor, I am here to take care of this process. How much were you planning on offering?"
1, I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
0, We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room. Let's offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars.
1," That sounds good, but I don't want this house to get away from me."
0," The market is fairly down right now, so the offer is a realistic one."
0, When will we know if they accept the offer?
0, The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days.
0, Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime?
1," You are already pre-qualified for your loan, so you are in good shape."
-1, I have never bought a house before and don't know how to make an offer. 
0, The process of actually making the offer is something that I will take care of for you. What price were you considering offering?
1, I love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
1, Let's leave some room on this offer. I think that three hundred and twenty thousand dollars is a fair offer in this housing market.
1," We could try that, but I really want this house!"
0, It is common practice to offer and then have a counter-offer.
0, Have the owners come up with a counter-offer to my offer to buy their home yet?
0, The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars.
0, Should I accept their offer?
0, There are two ways to respond. You can either come back with another offer or go with their counter-offer.
0," What if I make another offer, and they don't accept it?"
0," No one else has made an offer, so you could make another offer if you want to do so."
0, I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer.
1," OK, I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight."
0, How long before I find out what their decision is?
0, It will go quickly.
0, Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house.
0," To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars."
1, I think that maybe I should accept their offer.
0," You, of course, have two ways of responding. You can say yes or come up with another offer."
-1," I want to make another offer, but I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house. "
0," There is always a chance that someone could outbid you, but you could try one more offer if you like."
0, I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer.
0," After the owners get home from work tonight, I will approach them with your offer."
0, Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me?
0, I don't think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer.
0, Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house?

0, You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer.
0," If I make another offer and they refuse, then what?"
0," Personally, I would consider making one more offer, but it is up to you to decide what to do."
0, Let's try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer.
0, I will contact the sellers with your current offer.
0, Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly?
0, Usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly than the first one.
0, Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer?
1," Yes, and I think I have good news for you."
0, Did they accept the counter-offer?
1," Yes, they accepted your counter-offer, but they want you to pay for the home inspection."
0, How much will that cost?
0, It will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection.
0, Can I choose the home inspector?
1," Yes, you are paying for it, so you get to choose. I would pick the best one."

0, Let's sign the registry. The realtor looks kind of busy right now.
0," OK, let's go check out the kitchen next."
0," look, they have some refreshments in here."
0, Make sure that you pick up a flyer with the information about the home.
0, Does it say how much they are asking for this house?

0," I see an Open House sign over there, and I think we should go check it out."
1, I think that looks like a very nice house. Is it on our Internet listing for Open Houses?
0," Yes, I see it listed on the printout we got off of the Internet."
1, I love the beautiful lawn. What a great front entryway!
0, We need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor knows we were here.
0, That works for me. We can check out the kitchen next.
1," On such a hot day, it is thoughtful to have water out for potential buyers."
0, Check out the flyer with all of the home's information on it.
0, What is the price of this house in the flyer?
0, They have changed the asking price since it first went on the market. It is now two hundred and twenty-five thousand.
1, I would love to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front.
1, What a wonderful neighborhood! Can you find that house on our Open House list?
0," Yes, that is one of the houses that we have on our list."
1, They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses. Let's see what the inside looks like.
0, I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here.
1, Signing the registry is a good idea. I think I want to see the kitchen next.

0, Is the current asking price listed on the flyer?
0, The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars.
0," I heard that you finished my home inspection, and I was wondering how it went."
0," First of all, we need to understand what I was looking for. Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is?"
-1, I am not sure what a home inspection is all about. 
0," I went there to check for problems with the home, so you aren't surprised when you move in."
-1, Wouldn't the owners have told me about any problems? 
-1," Sellers aren't always truthful, and there might also be problems that they aren't aware of. "
0, Can I require the owners to fix the problems?
0, You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems.
0, What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home?
0, There were no major problems. One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found.
0, I am here to sign my escrow papers.
1," I will tell you ahead of time, that there is a lot to sign here, but I will help you every step of the way."

0, Where do I start?
0," We will be going through these papers one by one. I will be explaining them all to you, and you can ask questions as we go."

0, There are a lot of papers.
1, We are going to go through these bit by bit. You will have plenty of time to read the fine print.

0, Can I start moving in after I finish signing these documents?
1," When these papers get processed, the house will be yours!"

0, You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name.
1, I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned.
0," If I were you, I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in."
0, I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in.
0," That way, someone will be there, but you will have them right away."
0, What would be a good day to finally move into the house?
0, You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night. When you actually move in is up to you.
0," Will the electricity and water be on, or do we need to do something to get it turned on?"
0, Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in.
0," The carpet needs to be cleaned, and I want to paint the walls a different color."
1, An empty house is easier to paint and clean. Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in.
0, I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house.
1, I think that will work out just fine. It will help when you move your groceries in and need to keep them cold.
0, Would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day I move in?
1," OK, that is ok."
1, My clients are very interested in the house.
0, How much do they want to offer?
0," They are willing to offer $10,000 less than the asking price."
0, I will contact my client and see if she will accept the offer.
1, My clients are very nice people with two small kids.

0, I'm here to buy a sweater.
0, What size do you wear?
0, I usually wear medium.
0, What do you think about this one?

0, How much is this car?
0," It is $30,000."
-1, That's a little high. 
1, It's in excellent condition with low miles on it.
0," I'll give you $22,000 for it."
-1, That's a bit low. 
0, How low can you go?
0," I can sell it to you for $28,000."
-1," That's not much of a discount. How about $25,000? "
0, Let me talk to my manager.

-1," Unfortunately, this is one of the least expensive bikes we have. "
0, I see.
1," This bike has an adjustable height. So, it will grow a few inches as your child grows."
1, That's a great feature. I think I will buy it.
0," Can I help you, sir?"
0, I need to buy a birthday present for my wife.
0, Ok. What does she like?
-1, I'm not sure. 
0," What would you like to buy her? A purse, makeup, shoes, clothes, perfume?"
1, All of those things sound nice.
0, Do you know her clothing size?
-1," No, I don't. "
0, What about her shoe size?
-1, I don't know that either. 
0, I see. Should we look at purses then? What is her taste? Does she like leather?
0, I think so.
0, What is her favorite color?
0, Red.
1, Great! We have some lovely purses in red. Would you like to take a look at them?
0, Sure.
0, How about this one?

0," Ok, Mr. NAME. My name is NAME. What kind of phone would you like?"
0, I have a basic phone right now. I would like to upgrade.
0, Do you want a smart phone?
0, Yes. I would like to be able to check e-mails and surf the Internet.
0, Ok. We have many phones to choose from.
1, I would like something that is not too expensive.
0, Ok. We can find you something for sure.
1, I would also like a good camera.
1, What about this phone? It has many good features and it is on sale.
-1, It feels a little heavy. Do you have anything lighter in weight? 
0, How about this one? It is the same price as the other one.
1, This one seems nice. Does it come with a warranty?
1," Yes. If it stops working within one year, we will replace it for free."
1, That's great! I will get this one.
1, Wonderful. Is there anything else I can help you with?
1, No. You have been very helpful.
0, Hey NAME. What are you doing today?
0, Hey NAME. My wife and I are going to buy our daughter a car.
1, Wow! That's quite a gift!
1, I know. It's a graduation gift.
0, Are you going to buy a new or used car?
0," Used. It will be her first vehicle, so she doesn't need a brand new one."
0, I'm actually selling my car. Would you be interested?
0, Is it the red one?
0," Yeah, that's the one."
1, My daughter would love that car.
1, It's in great condition. I've taken good care of it.
0," How many miles does it have on it? And, how much do you want for it?"
0," 35,000 miles. $7,000."
1, That's pretty good. Why are you selling it?
0, My wife and I are having a baby. We need to get a bigger car.
1, Congratulations on your new baby!
1, Thanks.
0, Do you know where I can buy a new dishwasher?
0, I think the home improvement store is having a big sale this weekend. Is your dishwasher broken?
0, Yeah. I need to replace it.
0, Have you tried to repair it?
0," Yeah, we called a repairman yesterday. He said that it would cost more to repair than to replace it."
1, Wow. At least he was honest about it.
-1, I know. I appreciated that. We really can't afford to buy a new one right now. We just had a baby a couple of months ago. But I really need one. 
0, That's right. You had a baby not too long ago. Why don't you buy a used one?
0, Where can I get a used one that's in good condition?
0, I actually have a friend who is selling hers. She said there isn't anything wrong with her current one. She just wants a different color. Her current one is white.
1, I don't care what color it is. I just want one that works well. Do you know how much it is?
0, I don't know. Let me call her right now.
-1, Thanks. I'll talk to my husband too. He may not want a used one. He's a little picky about appliances. 
1, Ok. Let me know if he's interested.
1, I am so excited today!
0, What's going on today?
0, I'm buying my first car.
1, That is exciting!
0, I've been saving money for the last couple of years and now I have enough to put a down payment on a car.
0, Are you going to buy a new or used car?
0, A new one.
0, Do you know which one you want?
0," Yeah, I have a picture of it on my phone."
1, That's nice!
1, But I want it in blue. Blue is my favorite color.
1, Make sure you negotiate a good deal.
-1, I know. That's my problem. I'm not good at negotiating. 
1, I'm great at it. Do you want me to go with you to the dealership?
1, That would be awesome!
1, Ok. I'll drive since you will be driving your car home today.
1, Let's go!
0, Hi NAME. What are you doing here?
-1, Hey NAME. I need to buy my sister a new necklace. I accidentally lost her necklace and she is really mad at me now. 
-1, But you said it was an accident. 
-1," Yeah, but I didn't ask if I could borrow it. "
-1," Oh, that's not good. "
1," She wasn't home and it looked nice with my outfit, so I wore it."
-1, That's like stealing. 
-1, I know. I feel terrible. I was going to put it back when I got home. 
0, How did you lose it?
-1, I don't know. I was on my way home and I noticed it was gone. 
0, Was it an expensive necklace?
-1, I don't know. I'm looking for a replacement here. 
0, What does it look like?
0, It's a gold butterfly.
0, Like this one?
1, That's it! That's exactly like hers! How much is it?
0, The price tag says $100.
-1, Wow! That's expensive. Now I see why she was really mad. 
0, Hey NAME. What are you doing today?
0," Oh, hey NAME. I'm going furniture shopping with my wife."
0, Are you looking for anything special?
-1, Yeah. We need a new sofa. Our old one is ripping. 
0, We just bought a new sofa.
0, Did you get a good deal?
1," Yeah, it was on sale. You should go check it out."
0, Where did you go?
0, We went to the new store across the street.
0, I saw a flyer for that in the mail. I think that's where my wife wants to go.
0," If you bring the flyer, you get 10% off this weekend."
1, That's good to know! Thanks for telling me.
0, Do you know what kind of sofa you want?
0, Yeah. We want a dark brown leather sofa.
1, That's exactly what we bought.
1, Your wife and my wife must have the same taste in furniture.
0, Hello?
0, Hi NAME. This is NAME. Do you have time for lunch today?
0," No, I have to go to the mall. I have to get a birthday present for NAME."
0, What are you going to get him?
0, I don't know. He seems to have everything.
0, Does he have a hobby?
1," Yeah. He loves golf, but he has everything he needs for golf."
0, What about clothes or shoes?
1, He has plenty of clothes and shoes.
0, Jewelry?

0, Sure. We can grab lunch at the mall.
0, Excuse me. Could you help me with something?
1, I'll certainly try.
0, I'm looking for a nice sweater.
0, What size do you wear in a sweater?
0, Medium is my size for shirts and sweaters.
0, Here's a medium. What do you think?
1, I like it. Where can I try it on?
0, We have a large fitting room in that corner.
0, Hey NAME. What are you doing today?
0, I'm going to the electronics store with my son.
0, Are you buying a new TV?
-1, No. My son has been saving money to buy a tablet. They're so expensive. 
1, That's so nice of you.
0," His birthday is next week, so this is his birthday present."
0, Why don't you buy one for yourself?
1," I already have one. My son really likes it. So, he wants one of his own."
1," Oh, I see. They're great. They're like mini computers. I love the touch screen feature."
-1, I know. My son keeps taking mine. I'm tired of sharing it with him all the time. 
0, Is that why you are helping him buy one?
0, Yes. Do you have one?
0, Yeah. I should get another one too.
0, Why?
0, My daughter keeps taking mine. Let me know if there are any sales.
0," Mom, can I get a new toy?"
0," No, NAME. We're here to buy your cousin a birthday present."
0," Please, Mom."
0, No. Can you help me find something for your cousin? What does he like?
0, This toy helicopter.
0, I think that's what you like.
1, He'll like it too.
0, Are you sure?
1, Yeah. He and I like the same things.
1, Ok. Let's get him that helicopter.
1," I can play with it at his house. If I like it, then can I get one, too?"
0, Maybe for your birthday.
1, Great! My birthday is next month.
1," You are a smart boy, NAME."
1," Thanks, Mom."
0, Where is NAME?
-1, She's not coming to work today. She's sick. 
0, Again?
-1, Yeah. She called in sick a few minutes ago. 
-1, That's strange. 
0, What's strange?
0, I saw her get into a taxi this morning. She was carrying luggage.
0, Do you think she was going on a trip?
-1, It looked like it. Doesn't she always call in sick on Fridays? 
-1, She is faking it. 
0," Can I have a cookie, B?"
0, No. We're going to have dinner soon.
-1," But, I'm hungry. "

0," NAME, an old friend from college."
0, When is the last time you talked to him?
1, At college graduation!
1, Wow! That was 30 years ago!
0, We had a lot of catching up to do.
0, Did you hear about NAME NAME?
-1, Yeah. I can't believe she's getting a divorce already. 
0, I know. She just got married last month.
-1, I thought they would get divorced after one year. 
-1, Celebrities never stay married. 
-1, This actually shouldn't be big news. 
0, Did you hear about NAME?
0, No. What happened?
-1, He was arrested for drugs. 
0, I didn't hear about that.
0, It's been all over the news.
-1, I don't watch the news. 
-1, I'm not surprised he was caught with drugs. 
0, Why?
-1, He was acting strange during his last concert. 
-1, I missed that too. 
0, NAME wants a cell phone.
-1, She doesn't need a phone yet. She's too young. 
0, She says all of her friends have one even a nine-year old named NAME.
0, What do you think?
1, I think it would be a good idea in case of an emergency.
-1," She's only 10. If she has an emergency, she would be with one of us. "
0, Did you hear the news? The CEO is going to be at the presentation.
-1, That's not good. 
0, Why?
0, I'm giving the presentation.
1, You'll be fine.
-1, I heard she is really picky. 
0, Yeah. That's what I heard too.
0, What should I do?
0, Just be prepared.
0, Can you listen to my presentation and let me know what you think?
1, Sure! Let's get started now.
1," Okay, thank you so much."
0," Hi, what will you do with those things?"
-1, I will throw them away. I don't need them anymore. 
-1, Don't throw those electronic waste carelessly! It's dangerous for our environment! 
-1, Listen to me! It's none of your business. These things are mine. Please leave me alone! 
-1," But we should protect our environment as good as possible, because it can influence our lives. "
-1, Really?? What happens with this broken cell phones? Broken computer? Should I keep them and fill up my house with these unuseful things? 
-1, I don't say that. But do you know that every year more than 10.000 of computer monitors and TV become obsolete? Electronic waste is toxic and contaminate the soil. 
0, How do you know it?
-1," Look at this. This battery contains lithium, this microchip contains arsenic, phosphorus, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and more hazardous materials. Those materials are not just contaminate the soil, but they can damage the brain and give bad effects for our health. "
0," Oh, I see. So where should I throw these things?"
0, You can drop your electronic waste in the box network or sell them to be recycled.
1," Alright, I think you right. Sorry for being rude."
1, Itâ€™s ok.
1," Anyway, thank you."
0, What do you think?
1, It looks great.

0, What did you have for lunch?
0, A salad.
0, What else did you have for lunch?
-1, That's it! I had a small salad. I'm starving. 
0, I need to change my flight departure.
0, When do you need to go?
0, I need to leave tomorrow morning.
0, Can it be a non-direct flight?
1, I would prefer a direct flight.
0, There is one direct flight leaving tomorrow morning at 7 AM. It's $100 more expensive.
0, I'll take it.
0, When will you be returning?
0, Don't change the return flight.
0, Ok.
0, I think we should change the vacation policy.
0, Why?
-1, Other companies have paid vacation. We do not. 
-1, We are a small company. We can't afford paid vacations. 
1, Paid vacations would make employees work better.
0, How?
1, Give employees good benefits and they will work harder.
-1," You have a point, but we cannot afford it. "
-1, This company is never going to grow if we don't take care of our employees. 
-1," I agree, but I don't make the rules. "
0, Hey B! Did you hear what happened in my History class today?
0," No, what happened, A?"
-1, Someone got caught cheating on the test. 
0, Are you serious? Who?
0, NAME!
-1," NAME? Didn't he get caught cheating last month, too? "
0, Yeah!
0, How did he cheat?
0, He wrote some things on his hand and Mrs. NAME saw it.
0, What did Mrs. NAME do?
0, She sent him to the principal's office. I think they called his parents. I saw them walking into the school office.
-1, Wow! He's going to be in big trouble. 
-1, I know! His dad is really strict. 
0, Do you think they are going to suspend him from school?
-1," I don't know. But if he continues to cheat, Mrs. NAME isn't going to be able to trust him anymore. "
-1," Not only Mrs. NAME, but other teachers too. "
0, What was that loud boom?
-1, There was a chemical explosion a few blocks away. 
0, Did anyone get hurt?
-1," Yeah, over 50 people were injured. "
0, Do we need to evacuate the building?
-1, Yes! Don't take the elevator. 
0," B, are you going to join the Choir Club?"
0," No, A. I'm not."
1, Why? You have such a beautiful voice.
-1, I'm too shy. 
1, You sing so well. You could probably get a solo.
-1, Thanks for the compliment. I'm scared to sing in front of an audience. 
-1," You're wasting your talent. If I could sing like you, I would join the Choir. "
0, My mom said the same thing.
0, You should think about it again.
-1, What if I get on stage and I freeze. 
1, Maybe this is great way to overcome your fear.
1, I do love singing.
1, Then you should join. You'll make a great addition to the club.
1, Ok. Let me think about it.
0," NAME, I think it's time for you to start helping around the house."
1," Ok, Dad."
0, Your mom and I want you to start doing some chores.
0, Will I get an allowance like NAME?
0," Of course you will. First, let's start with cleaning up the playroom when it gets messy."
0, Ok. What else?
0, How about setting and clearing the dinner table.
1, These are easy.
0," And, loading and unloading the dishwasher."
0, Ok. Do I have to do all of these things every day?
0, No. I want you to share these chores with your sister. You can both decide which ones you want to do.
-1, That's not fair. 
-1, Why isn't this fair? 
-1, She's going to pick the easiest ones for herself and give me the harder chores to do. 
-1," No, she won't. "
0, You don't know NAME. I think I want a raise in my allowance.
0," Mom, are there any more chores to do around the house?"
0, There are always chores to do. Why?
0, I want to make more money. I'm saving up for something.
0, What is it?
0, It's a secret.
0, Ok. There are a couple of loads of laundry that need to be done.
1, Ok! I can do that.
0," They need to be washed, folded, and put away."
1, Got it!
0, Let me know if you want more to do after that.
0, Ok. I need a lot more to do.
1, I'm curious. What are you saving up for?
0, Do you promise not to say anything?
1, I promise.
1, I want to buy Dad a new watch for his birthday.
1, That's very sweet of you. He would love it!
0, I only have a couple of weeks to save until his birthday.
1," You're a good kid, NAME."
0," Mom, I'm home. Guess where we're going for our field trip this year."
0," Oh, hi NAME. Where?"
0, We're going to the city aquarium.
1, That sounds like a lot of fun. Marine animals are your favorite.
1, I can't wait to go. I'm so excited!
0, When is the field trip?
0," Next Wednesday. My teacher needs chaperones for the trip. Can you go, Mom?"
0, I think so. Let me check my schedule first.
1, I hope you can chaperone.
1, Me too. I love going to the aquarium.
0, We need to pack a lunch. We're going to eat at the aquarium.
1, Ok. I just looked at my calendar. I'm free that day.
1," That's great, Mom! I'll tell my teacher tomorrow."
0," Ok, now it's time to do your homework."
1, I'm so excited. I can't concentrate on studying.
0, I understand. But you still need to do your homework.
0, Does it look too big?
1, It looks like it was made just for you.
1," Yes, I like it. I'm going to get it."
0, How would you like to pay for it?
0, Here's my credit card.
0," Now, if you'll just sign here."
1, Yes. Here you are.
1, So long. Have a nice weekend.
0, Hey NAME. Do you have any boxes you're not using?
0, I think so. I have to check my garage.
1, Great. Thanks.
0, Are you moving?
0, No. I need to clean out my attic today. It's getting full up there.
-1, That's a big chore. 
-1, I know. I don't even remember what's in there anymore. 
0," Well, if you don't know what's in there, you probably don't need it."
0, That's what my wife said.
0, I had to clean out my attic last month and my wife said the same thing to me.
0, They must be talking to each other.
0, What are you going to do with all the stuff?
0, I think I'm going to have a garage sale next weekend. What did you do with all of your stuff?
0, I threw half of it away and donated the other half.
1, That's a good idea. Maybe I'll donate the things I don't need.
0, What about the garage sale?
0, That's just going to be another chore to do. I'd rather go golfing.
1, Good thinking!
0, Has NAME signed the contract?
0, Not yet. We're still working on it.
1, Why don't we take her out to lunch and discuss things?
1, Good idea. Maybe she has questions about the contract.
0, Do you know her favorite food or restaurant?
1, I know she loves French food.
1, Find the best French restaurant in the city.
0, Are you going to the cocktail party tonight?
0, Yes. I invited one of our clients.
0, Who?
0, NAME.
0, Our new client? The good-looking one?
0, Is he good-looking?
0, The coffee shop is busy today.
1," They are having a special. If you order a donut, you get a cup of coffee for free."
1, Wow! I love donuts and coffee.
0, Me too. How do you drink your coffee?
1, I like to add cream and sugar.
1, I like black coffee.
-1, Oh! the line is long. There are a lot of people here. 
-1, I hope they don't run out of coffee. 
-1, I hope they don't run out of donuts. 
-1, That would be worse. 
1, I feel like drinking some coffee.
1, That sounds good. Where do you want to go?
0, Let's go to Starbucks.
-1, I don't want to go to Starbucks. 
1, Why not? They have delicious coffee.
-1," That's true, but it is overpriced and I like to support small businesses. "
1, Fine. But next time we are going to Starbucks.
1, Fair enough.
0, Do you believe that coffee prevents cancer?
1, I want to believe it. I love coffee.
-1, But your coffee is not very healthy. 
0, Why do you say that?
0, You put lots of cream and sugar in your coffee.
1, It tastes better that way.
0, You should drink it black like me.
-1, It's too bitter. 
-1, I don't think your coffee will prevent cancer. 
1, I'm still going to believe it.
0," Hello, I need to register for a class."
0, What class are you trying to take?
0, I want to take a Psychology class.
0," Well, there are only two classes open."
0, Can you tell me what days the classes are on?
0, One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.
0, And the other class?
0, That class is from ten to twelve on Monday and Wednesday.

1, I'm positive.
0, Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday.
1," Okay, I'll sign you up."
0," Hello, how are you doing?"
1," Pretty good, and you?"
1, I'm doing great.
1, That's great to hear.
0, So how long have you been going to PCC?
0, I've been going here for a couple years now. You?
0, This is my first year.
0, How do you like it so far?
0, It's all right.
0, You don't like it?
1, I'll like it better once I finish my GE.
1, That's exactly how I used to feel.
0, How are things with you?
1, Not too bad. How about yourself?
1, Not bad.
1, I'm glad to hear that.
0, Have you been going to PCC long?
0, I've only been here two years. How about yourself?
0, I just started this year.
0, Do you like it?
1, It's fine for right now.
-1," You do not like it, right? "
1," Once I'm finished with my GE, it should get better."
1, I felt the same way my first year.
0, Does it look too small?
1, It fits you to a T.
1, I agree. I'm going to buy it.
0, Cash or charge?
0, I'll charge it.
0," Sign here, please."
0, There you go.
1," Good-bye, and thank you for shopping here."
0, How is everything going with you?
1, Great. You?
1, Pretty good.
1, Good for you.
0, When did you start going to PCC?
0, This is my second year. How about you?
0, I only got here this year.
0, Could you help me?
0, What do you need?
-1, I can't seem to find my class. 
0, What building is it in?
0, It's in the C building.
1," Oh, I know exactly where that is."
0, Do you think you can tell me where it is?
0," Sure, what room number is it?"
0, It's room number 261.
0, I have a class around there right now.
0, Could you show me where it is?
1," No problem, come on."
0," Excuse me, I need your assistance."
0," Sure, what's up?"
-1, I have no idea where my class is. 
0, Tell me which building it's in.
0, My class is in the C building.
0, I know where the C building is.
0, Do you mind telling me where it is?
1," Of course, which room number is it?"
0, Number 261.
0, I actually have a class right around there.
0, Can you please show me?
1, I can do that.
0, How do I buy my textbooks?
0, Do you have your book list for your class?
0," Yes, I have my list."
0," Fine. Once you have it, you can go to the bookstore. Do you know where that is?"
0," Yes, I know where the bookstore is."
0," OK, so once you pass the gym, it's the first door on your left. Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there?"
-1," No, I didn't know I could do that. "
0, You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door. Do you think you will be doing that today?
1," Yes, I am going today."
0," Well, if you decide to go, I could meet you over there at 1:00 today or tomorrow to help you. Would that work for you?"
1," Yes, thank you. That would be great."
0," Well, then, I'll talk to you later."
0, Where can I buy textbooks?
0," First, you need to have the list of books for your class. Do you have that?"
0," Yes, I have that."
0," Well, when you have that, you can take it over to the bookstore. Can you find it?"
-1," No, I don't know where the bookstore is. "
0, Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left. Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money?
0, Really? How can I do that?
0, Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today?
-1," No, I can't make it today. "
0, I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1:00 today or tomorrow. Would you like my help?
1," No, thanks. I'm good."
0, Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr. NAME?
0, Yes. Are you going to be taking a class from him?
-1," Yes, but I have never taken his class before. "
1, He is very interesting and challenging. Is that what you are looking for?
1," Yes, that's what I need."
1, He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade. Are you willing to study hard?
0," Yes, I guess so."
1, What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher. Do you enjoy that in a teacher?
0," Yes, I had a teacher like that before."
0, Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?
1," No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing."
1," Well, take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you. Good luck!"
0, Do you know anything about Dr. NAME's classes?
0, Yes. Are you in his class?
0, I'm thinking of taking his class next semester.
-1," He really knew his stuff, but he graded hard. Would that be OK? "
1," Yes, I really need someone who is really good."
1, I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it. Can you do that?
-1," Maybe, but I'm not sure. "
1," Man, this guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, don't you?"
-1," No, that stuff isn't important to me. "
1, Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?
-1, I don't care about any of that. 
0, Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. NAME's classes?
0, Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes?
0, I'm thinking about taking his class next semester.
1, He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?
-1," I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, but I also worry about grades. "
-1," Grades are important, but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important, too? "
0, I really need to learn this stuff.
1, He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know what I mean?
1," Yes, that sounds right for me."
0, Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?
1," Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing."
1, I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you. Enjoy your year!
0," Professor, could I make an appointment with you?"
0," I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four, do you have a particular time in mind?"
1, Two o'clock would be the best time.
0," Fine, do you know where my office is?"
-1," No, I'm not sure. "
0," Remember, it is in the E building on the third floor."
0, I see.
1," Don't worry, it will work out fine once you get there. I'll see you then."
0, I'll see you then.
1, Looking forward to meeting with you!
0," Excuse me, Professor, is there a time when I could meet with you?"
0, I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four; what time works out best?
0, I would like to come in at three o'clock.
0, Can you find my office?
0," Yes, I can."
0, Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor.
0, I got it.
0," If you do get lost, just ask someone in the building to point the way."
1," Thank you, I'll be there."
0," If you need to cancel your appointment, please give me a call!"
1, Does it look like a good fit?
1, It's definitely your size.
1," Yes, it is very nice. I'll take it."
0, How do you prefer to pay?
0, Let me use my credit card.
0," Now, if you'll just sign here."
1, No problem.
1, I hope you enjoy your purchase. Good-bye.
0," Professor, do you have a few moments when I could meet with you?"
0, I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday; what works best for you?
1, Three would be a good time.
1," Great, do you need directions to my office?"
-1, I'm not sure. 
0," Well, just make sure to go through the double doors, and I'll be on the right."
1," OK, I'll find it."
1, It's very easy to find.
0, See you then.
1, I will enjoy seeing you; have a good week!
0," Excuse me, Professor. I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done."
0, What happened that you didn't get it done?
0, I had to watch a football game instead.
-1," Well, you had more than one day; couldn't you have fit it in on another day? "
0," Yes, I think so."
0," Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?"
0, I'll make it up next week.
-1," Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an A in the class. "
1," OK, I can do that."
-1," Remember that you are in college now, not high school. "
0, Let me tell you what happened to my homework.
-1," OK, go ahead, what is the excuse THIS time? "
-1," Actually, I did it, but then it got lost. "
0, Could you have gotten it done at another time?
0," Yes, I could."
0," You have never missed an assignment before, when will you be making this one up?"
0, I'll make it up early next week.
-1," That would work, but don't let it happen again. "
0, I'll try.
-1, That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again. 
0," Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score."
0, Sure. Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right?
0, I think that the percentage is incorrect.
0, Let's just go over all of it to double check.
0," Sure, let's do it."
0, Here is the answer sheet. Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right?
1, I don't see any mistakes.
0," OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score."
0," Yes, let's total it."
0," Well, if I total that like this and divide by this number, I get this total. Do you agree?"
1," Yes, you're right."
1," Well then, we are all straight. Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention."
0, I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher.
0, Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?
0, I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right.
0," These things can happen; let's double check the answers first to be sure, all right?"
1, That would be great!
0, Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading?
0, This one right here should be right.
0," Yeah, I see the same thing; now we can do the math and check that, right?"
0," Yeah, let's do the math."
0," I count all of the correct answers, total them, and divide by the total. Does this look right to you?"
1, Looks pretty good.
1, Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores; keep studying!
0, Do you have the notes from last week's class?
0, Did you come late?
-1, I couldn't make it. 
0, Why is that?
-1, I was sick. 
1," Oh, okay. Well, here you go."
0, Are these all of them?
0," Oh, wait, here are the rest."
1, Thanks a bunch.
1, Don't mention it.
0, Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week?
0, Were you here last week?
-1, I was unable to make it. 
0, How come?
-1," I was sick that day, and couldn't make it. "
0," Well, here are the notes."
0, Are there any more?
0," Sorry, here you go."
1, Thanks a lot.
1, No problem.
0, I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades.
0," Grades are based on many things: homework, attendance, quizzes, mid-term, and final."
0, What counts the most?
0, Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation.
0, Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?
0," Homework, attendance, and quizzes are sixty percent; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each."
0, What if we miss something?
0, I will allow one unexcused absence; after that you need to contact me ahead of time.
0, Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?
0, You will be able to track your progress during the year.
0, What do you base our grades on?
0," All of your coursework is important, including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester."
0, Does the final count the most?
0, All of it is important; please just do your best at all times.
0, How do you total our scores?
0," The final and mid-term are twenty percent each; homework, attendance, and quizzes are the rest."
-1, What if we are out sick? 
0, Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence.
0, How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?
0, Your grade will not be a surprise; you will know what you need to work on.
0, I'd like to talk to you about my grades.
0, Sure! What exactly do you have questions about?
-1, I am worried that I messed up on a test. 
0," Well, let me take a look at my grade book. How do YOU think you are doing?"
-1," I think I am doing great, except for that one test! "
0," Well, your scores show that you could do a little better. What do you think you could improve on?"
0, I think that I could study a little harder for tests.
0, Fine! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin.
0," Yes, I know."
1, I'm sure you'll do fine.
0, How does it look?
1, It's a perfect fit.
0, Let me pay for it now.
0," Cash, credit card, or debit card?"
0, I think I'll use my credit card.
1," Your signature here, please, and we're finished."
0, Here's my NAME.
1, Bye-bye. Visit us again soon!
0, Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades?
0, Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern?
0, Am I failing?
0, Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?
-1, I am pretty sure that I am in trouble. 
0," I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve?"
-1, I missed a few classes; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis. 
0," Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right?"
-1, I'll try; it's hard! 
1, Thanks for stopping by!
-1," Professor, I'm concerned about my grades. Do you have a minute? "
1," Of course, how can I help you?"
0, I want to know if I am doing OK.
0, Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?
-1, I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well. 
0," I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others."
0, I think I could take better notes and read a little more.
1, You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on.
1, I'm working on it!
1, Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement.
0," Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class."
0, Is this something that you could schedule for another time?
-1," No, I have to do this, it's important! "
0, Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?
0, I've made arrangements with a friend to help me.
-1," You know that I only allow one absence per semester, don't you? "
0," Yes, I know."
0, Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me.
1," OK, I can do that."
1," Well, have a good day off from class."
-1," Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting. "
0, Is this absolutely necessary?
-1," I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class. "
0, Will you be able to make up the work you missed?
0, I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading.
-1, Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester. 
0," Yes, I remember."
0, Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?
1," Sure, no problem."
-1, Make good use of that day off; you'll only have one this semester! 
-1, I have to miss school next week. 
0, Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here?
-1," Unfortunately, this is what I have to do. "
0, How are you going to catch up?
0, I've got it all covered.
0, Fine.
0," Professor, I am going to need to leave class early today."
0, What is the problem?
0, I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative.
0, Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?
0," Yes, I've got that part covered."
0," When, exactly do you need to leave?"
0, I don't need to leave until the very end of class.
0," Fine, but next time try and not have to miss class again."
1," Thanks, Professor. See you later!"
1, See you later! Drive carefully.
-1," Excuse me, Professor, I have a problem and need to leave class early. "
0, Why do you have to leave early?
-1, I am not feeling well. 
0, Could you make it up by attending my other section this week?
0," Yes, it's all taken care of."
0, Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes?
0, I can stay a few more minutes.
0," OK, but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed."
-1," I am sorry, but I can't stay until the end of class. "
0, Where do you need to be that is more important than school?
0, I have an appointment.
0, Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?
0," No, but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work."
0, Are you going to go right away?
0, I am leaving right now.
0," All right, but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up."
0, I have an appointment for 1:30.
0, What can I help you with?
-1," Well, I have a problem with my class schedule. "
0, What is it?
0, It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time.
0, I can understand the problem with that.
0, Is there any way that you can fix my schedule?
0," No problem, do you want those classes still?"
0," Yes, I do."
0, Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day.
1, Thank you very much.
-1, I am unsure how to add a class and need help. 
0, I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign?
0," Yes, I have an add sheet."
0," After I sign it, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?"
-1," No, I'm not sure. "
0," When you cross the quad, the office is right in front of you. Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line."
1, Thanks. I understand what to do now.
1," It should be easy to find. After you add the class, check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet."
1, That sounds good.
1," Good, just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class. Good luck!"
0, I'd like to return this radio.
1, All right. Do you have the receipt?
0, Here it is.
0, May I ask why you're returning the radio?
-1, It does not work very well. 
0, Would you like to exchange it?
-1, No. I'd just like a refund. 
1, Certainly. This will take only a few seconds.
0," Professor, can you help me add your class?"
0, You have to bring me an add sheet to sign. Do you have one?
-1," No, I will have to get an add sheet. "
0, You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?
-1," No, I don't know where that is. "
0, The office is in front of you as you cross the quad. The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be.
1, I think I can find it.
1, You'll find it easily. Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on.
1, Thank you for letting me add your class.
1," To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. Good luck!"
0, When are we leaving for our field trip?
0, Our science field trip is next Monday at 8:00 in the morning. Can you mark that on your calendar?
0," Yes, I will write that down."
0," That will be Monday, December 2nd. We need to start loading the buses half an hour early, so plan to arrive at 7:30."
0," Yes, I will be there on time."
0, We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up?
0," Yes, someone is coming to get me."
0, The return bus will leave the campground at 5:00 p.m. and return to campus 3 hours later at 8:00 p.m.
0, What should we bring with us?
0, I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page. Check it out when you get a chance.
0, Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is?
0, We are leaving on our science field trip at 8:00 a.m. next Monday. Do you have something to write that down on?
0," Yes, I can write that on my calendar."
0, That will be on the second of December. Be there an hour early to get your bags on the bus. Do you understand?
0," Yes, I understand."
0, The bus will bring you back 6 days later on December 8th. Is someone coming to get you?
-1," No, I don't have a ride yet. "
0, We will be leaving the campground at 5:00 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8:00 p.m. Any more questions?
0, How much will the trip cost?
0, I put all of that information in the packet. I'll give you another copy if you need one. See you on Monday!
0," Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch?"
1, Sure! What kind of food would you like?
0," I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe."
1, I know the perfect place!
1, Good! Where is it?
1, It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you?
1, That would be great.
1, Glad you asked me to join you. This will be fun!
0," Man, I'm hungry. Do you know a good place to have lunch?"
1," Yes, I know a great place. What types of food do you like?"
1," Mexican, Japanese or Chinese would be great."
0," Oh, I know a place where you might like to eat."
0, Is it close by?
0, It's down a block on the right; can I show you the way?
1," OK, I'd love the company."
1, This will work out well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
0," Let's have some lunch, do you know of a great restaurant somewhere?"
0," I'm hungry, too. What types of food sound good?"
0," Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something."
1, I have a great idea of where you might like to go.
0, Can we walk there?
0, It's on the second floor. May I join you?
1, Of course! Let's go.
0, Can you help me figure out how to use this machine?
1," Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy?"
0, I want to buy that candy.
0, OK. So this machine will make change if you need it. Do you have your dollars ready?
1," Yeah, so far, so good."
0," Next, you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot. Make sure they are smooth."
0," Yeah, I already knew that."
0," I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck, you might have to re-feed it."
1," OK, let's move on!"
0," Now you just make your selection and pray. If nothing comes out, try again or call the number on the side of the machine."
1, I hope it works!
1," Well, good luck!"
-1, I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help. 
1," Sure, no problem. What are you trying to get?"
0, I want to buy a drink.
0, OK. This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change.
0, I've got the correct change already.
0, First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot. The dollars have to be smooth.
0," OK, what next?"
0, Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again.
0," OK, next?"
0, Choose what you want and push the button. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.
0, I agree with you.
1, Hope that works for you!
0, I want to know how to buy something from this machine.
0," Yeah, What are you trying to buy?"
0, I want to buy one of those snack things.
0, Are you ready to go?
1, I'm clear so far.
0, The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in.
-1, It won't go in! 
0, Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work.
0," Yes, next step."
-1, Make your selection and hope for the best. Vending machines aren't all that reliable. 
-1, They're totally unreliable. 
1, You seem to have it down. Have a good day!
0, Excuse me. I am interested in getting a library card.
0," Sure, let me give you an application. You can fill it out right here at the counter."
1," OK, here it is."
0," Let me take a look at this for you. May I have your driver's license, please?"
0, Here's my license and form.
0, You seem to have filled the form out all right. Are you familiar with our rules and fines?
0," Yes, I know what to do."
0, The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout.
0," OK, I see."
1, Thank you for joining the library; we look forward to serving you.
0, I want to return this radio.
1, Okay. May I see your receipt?
1, Certainly. I have it right here.
0, What is the problem with the radio?
-1, It has poor reception. 
0, Perhaps you'd like a different one?
-1," No, thank you. A refund is all I want. "
1," Okay. Give me a few seconds, please."
0, I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card.
0," Of course, just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished."
0, I'm finished.
0," I will also need your driver's license; hand me the filled-out form, please."
0," OK, the form is all filled out."
1, Perfect! Do you know the hours and rules for the library?
-1," No, I have no idea what they are. "
0, Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout.
1," Yes, right."
1, Great! You are all set to enjoy the library.
0, Can you help me with returning my late books?
0, This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here.
0," OK, here they are."
0, I can see that you owe 25 cents a day. That will be one dollar and fifty cents total.
0," OK, here's the money."
0," We are interested in getting our books back; so as long as all the fines are paid off by the end of the semester, you will be fine. Does that make sense?"
-1, I'm not sure. 
0, Your registration and transcripts can be held up if there is an outstanding fine.
0, Now I understand.
0," Well, you can always keep your late fees down by using the night drop if we are closed."
0, These books should have been turned in last week.
0, You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books.
0, Here they are.
-1," Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine. "
-1, I don't have the money right now. 
1, We only require that all fines must be paid off by the end of the semester. So you will be okay to go.
-1, What would happen if I didn't pay it? 
0," It's really important to always clear your fines, so you'll get a report card and transcripts on time."
-1," Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that. "
1," Always remember that the night drop is here, and we really appreciate you returning your books for all to use."
0," Excuse me, could you help me figure out how to use this new parking meter?"
0, Sure. Have you ever used a regular meter?
0," Yes, I understood the old one."
0," Well, on this one you can use coins or a debit or credit card; which one would you like to use?"
0, Debit or credit card.
0," OK. Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?"
0, Yes.
0," OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine."
1," Yes, I can do that."
0," now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also."
1," Yes, I'm ready."
0, All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard.
-1," Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before; how do you use it? "
1," It's simple, once you do it a few times. Do you know how the old one worked?"
-1, I never used a parking meter before. 
0, So we start out by deciding whether you will use cash or a credit or debit card.
0, Cash.
0," Fine, can you read the rate on the display?"
1," Yes, I can."
0," Fine. Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment."
-1," I'd rather not pay, but I have to. "
0," Fine, this machine does not ask you the number of your spot, so we can move on, all right?"
1," Perfect, let's do it."
0, Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have.
-1, This parking meter is really confusing. Can you help me figure it out? 
0," It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added."
1," Yeah, OK."
0," The first step is deciding on debit or credit card payment, so which one is it?"
0, I have coins.
1," Perfect. Now, can you see the rate on the sign?"
1," I didn't see that, but now I do."
0," Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in."
1, Here it goes!
1, You are doing great! Let's move on to the next step.
1, I am OK.
1," Just make sure that everything registered, and then you are good to go!"
0, Can you tell me where I can park?
0, Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile?
0, I drive an automobile.
0, Fine. You can either park in the student lot or on the street. Do you know what a handicapped space is?
0," Yes, I have seen those spots."
0," Well, when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo, do not park there unless you have a special permit. Are you going to be parking in the daytime or evening?"
0, I park in the evenings.
0, Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs. Have you seen those signs?
0," Yes, I have seen those signs."
0, The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days. Do you know how to read the curb colors?
0," Yes, I know what the curb colors mean."
0," Well, just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading, I think you know what you need to know."
0, Where should I park?
0, Do you have a car or motorbike?
0, I drive a scooter.
0," In that case, you can park either in a student lot or on the street. Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots?"
-1," No, I haven't seen those spots. "
0, The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit. Will you mostly be parking during the day or night?
0, I park in the daytime.
0, Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits. Have you noticed those signs?
-1," No, I have not seen the signs. "
0, Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there. Do you know what the curb colors mean?
-1," No, I don't know what the curb colors mean. "
1, Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only. I think you'll be good to go!
0," Hey, I got this parking ticket; can you help me figure a way out of it?"
0," First of all, did you park somewhere too long or in the wrong spot?"
-1, I was there too long. 
0, Was the area clearly labeled with the time limit and all?
0," Yeah, I saw it."
-1, You will need to convince the judge that you couldn't see the signs. 
1," Yeah, I understand."
1," Whatever you do, you need to be respectful and polite to the judge."
1," Yeah, you're right."
1, Just try to talk to him about how IF you made a mistake that it won't happen again.
1," OK, I will."
1, Good luck!
0, Did you call NAME last night?
-1," Yes. I tried to get a hold of him last night, but it was so difficult to get through. "
-1, That's strange. Maybe he was on the Net. 
-1, That's probably it! No wonder the line was busy all the time! Maybe he ought to get another line.Â  
0, Or he should get call waiting.
0, I need to return this radio.
1," That won't be a problem, as long as you have your receipt."
0, Here you go.
0, What's the problem?
-1, It doesn't pick up my favorite station. 
0, I can exchange it for you.
-1," Thanks, but I just want a refund. "
0, A refund it will be. Do you have the original box?
0, Pacific Bell. May I help you?
0," Yes, I'd like to set up a telephone service, please."
0, Do you presently have service?
1," No, this is new."
1, All right! I'll connect you with our customer service department. Please hold.
1, Thanks!
0," I'd like to have a phone installed, please."
0," May I have your name and address, please?"
0," Sure. My name is NAME. N-A-M-E. My address is 1600 NAME NAME, Apartment 16."
0," May I have your date of birth and your social security number, please?"
0," Sure! My date of birth is June 11, 1980. My Social Security Number is 000-00-0000."
1, Thank you very much! The earliest day for connection is this Friday. Is that OK?
1, That's fine! Thanks!
1," Thank you very much, Mr. NAME. Have a nice day!"
0," B, may I talk with you for a minute?"
0, Sure. What's on your mind?
1," Hmmm, nothing, really. Hey! Nice weather, isn't it?"
-1, Come on! Don't beat about the bush. Just tell me what's on your mind! 
0, Pacific Bell. May I help you?
0, I'd like to have my phone disconnected.
0, May I ask why?
0," Well, I'm graduated and am moving to California for a new job there."
1, Congratulations!
1, Thanks.

0, Sure. My phone number is 000-000-0000.

0," For security purposes, Mr. NAME, may I have your date of birth, please?"
0," It's June 5, 1978."
1," Thank you. Now, when would you like it to be disconnected?"
0, Tomorrow by 5:00 PM.
0, Sure. The telephone will be disconnected at 5:00 PM tomorrow.
-1, Why didn't you call me yesterday? 
-1," I tried to get a hold of you, but I couldn't get through. "
0, What time did you call? 
-1, I tried all morning! 
-1, Then I can't understand why you couldn't get through. 
-1, I kept getting a busy signal. 
-1, Hmmm. 
0, Is your phone out of order?
0, What do you mean?
-1," I tried calling you all night, but I wasn't able to get through. "
-1," Oh, I was on the phone all night. Sorry about that.Â  "
0," Well, you might wanna add call-waiting to your phone service if you're always on the phone."
0, I guess so.
-1," What's wrong with your phone, B? I tried to call you all night last night. "
-1, I'm sorry. No one was able to get through yesterday. My telephone was disconnected by the phone company. 
-1, What happened? Didn't you pay the bill? 
-1," Well, er, I forgot.Â  "
-1," Oh, we seem to have a bad connection on this phone. "
0," Could you speak up, please?"
-1, I'm talking as loud as I can. 
0, I'm going to hang up and call again.
-1, All right! 
0," Hello, may I speak to Mr. NAME?"
0, He just left.
0, When do you expect him back?
-1," I'm sorry, but he's gone for the day. Would you care to leave a message? "
0, Could you tell him that A NAME called and have him call me back tomorrow?
0, Sure. May I have your phone number?
0, I think he has my number.
1," Thank you, Mr. NAME. I'll tell him you called."
1, Thanks!
0," Hello, May I speak to Mr. NAME?"
-1, He's out to lunch. Would you like to leave a message? 
0, What time do you expect him back?
0, Mr. NAME should be back in half an hour.
0, I'll try back later.
0, I'm returning this radio.
1," No problem. You do have your receipt, don't you?"
0, Here you are.
0, What seems to be the problem?
-1, It doesn't have a headphone jack. 
0," If you'd like, I can show you a different one."
-1," No, thanks. A refund will be just fine. "
1, No problem. This'll only take a minute.
0," B, can you come to a meeting on Friday?"
-1, I'm not sure. Let me check my schedule. What time are you having it? 
0, We're planning on having it around noon.
0, Let me get back to you in a few minutes.
1," Sure! If I'm not in, could you leave a message on my answering machine?"
1, Sure thing!
0," B, there's a Mr. NAME on the phone who wants to talk to you."
0, I'm busy at the moment. Can you ask him to hold? Tell him I'll talk with him in a few seconds.

0, You're going to have to make an appointment.
0, Can I make one right now?
0, When would you like the installation to be done?
0, I'm off this Friday.
-1, The only time we can come on Friday is at 3:00 pm. 
0, I'm going to need it installed earlier than that.
-1," I'm sorry, but we're booked up on Friday. "
0, Is Saturday any better?
1, Saturday is perfect. What time would you like?
0, Is 11:00 fine?
1, That's perfect. See you on Saturday.
-1, Don't wipe your nose on your sleeve. 
-1, But I don't have a tissue. 
0, Then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
-1, I didn't have time to get one from there. 
-1, Your sleeves are not tissues! 
-1," But Mom, all my friends use their sleeves. "
-1, That doesn't make it right. 
0, I saw Dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
0, I will talk to your father about that.
0, I bet Dad did it all the time when he was my age.
-1, I'm worried. 
0, Worried about what?
0, I'm getting married.
1," You should be happy, not worried."
-1," I am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility. "
0," Yes, you have to take care of your wife."
0, And I have to take care of our children.
0, Are you going to start a family?
1, Yes. We want to have a little boy and a little girl.
1, That sounds wonderful.
-1, Except we can't afford it! 
0, No wonder you're worried.
-1, I don't get art. 
0, Or artists.
-1, They're in a different world. 
0, I saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
0, The artist said the jar was both full and empty.
-1, But it was full of pencils! How could he say it was empty? 
0, Artists see things differently.
0, Did you ever see anything that NAME painted?
1, Of course! He's world famous.
0, Did he ever take art lessons?
0, I can't believe it. I drew paintings like that in third grade.
0, Where are they? Maybe they are worth millions.
0," Would you help me, please?"
1, It would be my pleasure.
0, I want to return this opened DVD. Is that possible?
1, No problem at all. Do you have your receipt?
0, Let me dig it out of my wallet.
-1, I'm sorry. You can't return something more than 30 days old. 
-1, There must be some way around this. 
-1," I'm sorry, but I have to tell everyone the same thing -- no. "
-1, That's the dumbest rule I ever heard of. 
-1, Maybe the rules will change if we lose all our customers. 
0, What's the point?
0, The point of what?
0, Of living.
0," Who knows? You live, and then you die."
0, We must be here for some reason.
0, Maybe we're here to have fun.
-1, Then why aren't I having fun? 
-1, Because you're always thinking too much. 
-1, So I should stop thinking? 
0, Stop thinking about what the point is.
0, Okay. I'll start thinking about having some fun.
0, Just be patient. Fun doesn't come along every five minutes.
1, Beer is a powerful drug.
0, So are cigarettes.
0, Which would you prefer?
0, What do you mean?
0," When you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes."
0, I could pick only one or the other?
-1," Yes. Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven. "
-1," Boy, that's a tough one. "
0," What's so tough about it? Of course, I would pick cigarettes."
1, But cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
-1," Well, you can't have everything. "
-1, I don't think I want to go to your heaven. 
0, My pants have a hole in the front pocket.
-1, You shouldn't carry pens in your pocket. 
0, Yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.
0, Lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
0, Who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
-1," Criminals, of course. "
0," Anyway, I have to fix the hole."
0, You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
0, Tell me about this patch.
0, The patch has glue. The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
0, That sounds a lot easier than sewing.
0," It is. But after about ten washings, the glue washes off."
0, Do you know any good jokes?
0, I can't remember jokes.
0, Neither can I.
0, They go in one ear and out the other.
0, Who makes up all these jokes?
0, Who knows? But there must be a hundred new ones every day.
0," Yes, just in English alone."
0, I wonder if every language has jokes.
1, Of course! People everywhere like good jokes.
0, What do you think people joke about the most?
0, I think most jokes are about women.
0," Oh, really? I think most jokes are about men."
1, You're very lucky.
0, Why do you say that?
0, You speak two languages.
-1," Well, my English isn't perfect. "
0, No one speaks perfect English.
1, Maybe I will be the first!
0, I've been thinking about learning Spanish.
1, Spanish is easy. I'll be happy to teach you.
0, How long will it take me to learn?
0, I think it will only take you a year or two.
0, How soon can we begin?
1, Ahora! That means right now.
0, Do you know what today is?
0," Yes, it's April 22."
0, It's more than just a date.
0, Is it your birthday or anniversary?
0," No, it's Earth Day."
0, What's that?
0, It's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
0," Oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?"
1," Yes. We need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags."
0, How about if I take shorter showers?
1," That's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water."
0, From now on I'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.
-1, Poetry sucks. 
-1, I don't know anyone who likes it. 
1," Some of it is okay, I guess."
1," Yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember."
0," Like One, two, buckle my shoe."
0, But people still write poems.
0, No one makes any money at it.
0, NAME was a poet.
0, Did he get rich from his poetry?
0, Probably not.
0, Poems are a little bit like songs.
-1," Yes, but songs have music. Without music, songs would suck, too. "
0, I need somebody to come over and fix my internet.
0, What's wrong with it?
-1, For some reason it's just not connecting. 
0, How long have you been having this problem?
-1, It hasn't been working the past few days. 
0, Does the internet come up at all?
-1," It does, but it won't connect to anything. "
-1," Well, the internet isn't down, so there must be something wrong with your connection. "
0, Could you send someone to fix it today?
0, I'll send somebody over right away to fix it.
0, When will they be here?
0, They should be there in the next hour.
0, I need to get my internet fixed.
0, What's the problem with your internet?
-1, It won't connect. 
0, How long has this been happening?
-1, This problem has been happening for a few days now. 
0, The internet doesn't come up at all?
-1," It just won't connect to a webpage, but it will pop up. "
-1, There's obviously a problem with your connection. 
0, I'm going to need someone to come and fix it for me.
0, I can send somebody right now to fix it.
0, How smart are you?
0, I don't know. I think I'm average.
0, Did you ever take an IQ test?
0," No, I never did. All I know is that I got A's and B's in school."
-1, I wish I was really smart. 
-1, Don't be ridiculous. 
0, What do you mean?
0," If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous."
0, Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
-1, It must be very lonely. 
0, Why's that?
0," Because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying."
0, Can you help me pick out a gift for my daughter?
1, She might like a laptop computer.
1, That sounds like a good idea.
0, Might I suggest a Mac?
0, How much?
0," Well, a 15-inch Pro is $2,100."
1, That sounds great. I'll take it.
1, Great. How would you like to pay for it?
0, Here's my VISA.
1," Let me ring you up. Okay, sign here, please."
0, Everything I need is in this box?
1, It'll take her only a few minutes to get online.
1, Thank you for your help.
1, So long. Thank you for shopping here.
0, I missed the TV news last night. What was on?
0, Nothing that would pass as news.

0, Of course. She's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.
0, What are you going to do about your death?
0," Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it."
0," I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?"
0, My wife and I will be cremated.
0, Are you going to be buried next to each other?
0," Oh, no. Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean."
0, You're not going to be buried?
-1, A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space. 
0," Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you."
0, Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
0," That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people."
0, We figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.
0, Did you wipe your feet?
0," Yes, of course I wiped my feet."
0, Then why is there mud on the carpet?
-1, I don't know. It's not my mud. 
0," Well, someone brought it into the house."
1, Look at the bottom of my shoes -- they're clean.
-1, Of course they're clean. You left all the mud on the carpet. 
0," Okay, I'll get the vacuum cleaner."
-1, Don't vacuum it now. 
0, Don't you want me to clean up the mud?
0, Wait till it dries. It will be easier to vacuum.
0, Next time I will be careful.
0, What are you getting for your mom?
0, What are you talking about?
0, Sunday is Mother's Day.
0, This Sunday?
0, Of course. It's all over the news.
0, I thought it was next Sunday.
0," Well, you'd better get her something."
1, I'll get her a nice card.
0, Is that it?
0, Yes. That's all I ever give her.
0," She raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?"
1, It's okay. She knows that I love her.
-1, I don't like our flag. 
0, What's the matter with it?
-1, It's too much like other flags. 
0," Yes, a lot of flags have stripes."
1, A flag should be pretty.
0, What should our flag look like?
0, It should have a pretty woman on it.
-1, That's ridiculous! 
0, You don't like pretty women?
-1, Of course I do. But not on our flag! 
0, Every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
-1, You can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it! 
-1, I had a busy morning. 
0, What did you do?
0, I watered all the plants.
0, You have a lot of plants.
0, Then I did my laundry.
0, That takes some time.
0, I took the dog for a walk.
1, I'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
0, I vacuumed the entire house.
0, That's a lot of work.
0, And then I made lunch.
0, I'll bet you were hungry!
0, I don't have long distance service with my home phone.
0, So how do you make long distance calls?
0, I use a calling card.
0, Where do you get that?
0, I buy it at the dollar store.
0, How much is it?
0, It's one dollar for 100 minutes.
1, That's only a penny a minute!
0, It's a great price. But you have to dial a lot of numbers.
0, How many?
0," First you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers."
0, Yikes. I think I will not deal with this service.
0, I am calling about my cable service.
0, What's the problem?
-1, For the past week my cable hasn't been working. 
-1," I apologize, but the cable has been down lately. "
0, Do you know when it is going to start working again?
0," Give it a couple days, and it should be back on."
-1, Will I still have to pay for the cable while it's not working? 
0," Since it's not working, I'm going to give you a credit."
0, So I don't have to pay anything?
1, You won't pay anything until your cable starts working again.
1," Okay, thank you very much for your help."
1, No problem. Thank you for being so understanding.
0, I have a question about my cable.
0, What do you need?
-1, I haven't been able to watch my cable for the past week. 
-1, Right now the cable isn't working. 
0, Could you tell me when it will be back on?
0, The cable should be running again in a couple of days.
0," In the meantime, do I still have to pay for the cable?"
0, We'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience.
0, Does that mean I won't have to pay for it?
1, It'll be free until it comes back on.
1," Thanks, I appreciate your help."
1, Thank you for all your patience.
-1, I'm having problems with my computer. 
0, What's wrong with it?
-1, For some reason it won't turn on. 
0, Have you checked the connections on your computer?
0, What connections?
0, There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet.
0, Will the cords keep it from turning on?
-1, It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected. 
-1, I didn't think of that. 
0, Try it and see if it works.
0, I'm looking for a gift for my daughter.
0, How about a laptop?
1," Yes, she needs something to help her at school."
0, How about a Mac?
1, That sounds good. How much is one?
0," Our newest 15-inch Pro is only $2,100."
1," Only $2,100? Okay, let me have one."
1," That's great. Will that be cash, check, or credit card?"
0, Let me dig my VISA out of my purse.
0," If you'll just sign here, please."
0, Do I need to buy anything else?
1, All she has to do is open the box and follow the instructions.
1, Thank you so much.
1," Thank you. If you have any problems, just call."
-1, My computer isn't working. 
0, Tell me what the problem is.
-1," I'm trying to turn it on, but it won't work. "
0, Try checking the connections.
0, Which ones are you referring to?
0, The cords that you see behind your CPU that plug into an outlet.
0, Is that why it won't turn on?
0," If they're not connected right, that will keep it from turning on."
-1, I did not know that. 
0, You should check the connections.
0, I'm going to do that.
0, Tell me if it's still not working.
-1, Something's wrong with my computer. 
0, What's the problem?
-1, My computer won't turn on. 
0, Did you see if all the connections are right?
-1, I'm not sure I understand what you mean. 
0, The connections between your CPU and your outlet.
0, Is that what's stopping my computer from turning on?
-1," If your plugs aren't connected all the way, the computer won't turn on. "
-1, I had no idea. 
0, Why don't you try it and see what happens?
0, I'll try it right now.
0, Let me know if that doesn't work.
0, How are you doing today?
1, Great. What can I help you with?
0, I need to make an appointment for a haircut.
0, Okay. What day would you like to come in?
0, How's Saturday?
0, Let me just check the books.
1, Okay.
0, Yes. We have openings only that morning.

0, What day would you like to make the appointment?
0, I was thinking Saturday.
0, All right. Let me check to see if we have any openings that day.
1, That's fine.

1, I'll pencil you in for that time.
1, Thank you very much.
1, You're welcome. We'll see you on Saturday.
0, I want to try something different today.
0, What do you mean?
0, I want a different hair style.
0, What style do you want?
0, Can you make my hair short?
0, Exactly how short do you want it?
0, Make it a few inches long.
0, Are you sure you want me to cut it that short?
0, I've been thinking about this for a while now.
0, Let's do something different today.
0, Like how?

1, Fine then. Let's go.
1, I really want to switch things up.

0, What would you like me to do?
0, I want you to cut my hair shorter.
0, How short?

1, No problem. I'll see you next time.
0, I need help finding a gift for my daughter.
0, Would she like a laptop?
1, That sounds like a good idea.
1, A Mac is a very popular brand.
0, She mentioned a Mac. How much is it?
0," A 15-inch Pro model is $2,100 plus tax."
1, That sounds like a great price. I'll take one.
1, This is a gift she'll cherish for years. How do you want to pay?
0, I'll use my VISA.
0," We're almost through. Just sign here, please."
0, Just take it home and plug it in?
1, She'll be online 20 minutes after she opens the box.

0, I'm almost done.
-1, I needed you to be finished an hour ago. 
0, I'm all done now.
0, Are you sure you're finished?
-1, I don't understand. 
-1, You did a horrible job on my hair. 
0, What's wrong with it?
-1, I don't like anything about it. 
-1, I apologize. 
-1," That's fine, but I'm not paying for it. "
-1," Excuse me? Let's try to work this out, okay? "
-1, It's taking you forever to do my hair. 
0, Give me a minute.
-1, You should've been done already. 
1, There you go.
-1, I don't think that you're done. 
0, What's wrong?
-1, My hair looks hideous. 
0, What's so bad about it?
-1, It doesn't look good at all. 
-1, Sorry about that. 
-1, I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this. 
-1," Well, let me talk to my manager, okay? "
-1, What's taking you so long? 
1, Don't worry. I'm almost finished.
-1, I need you to hurry up. 
1, All right. I'm finished.
-1, I think there's more you need to do. 
0, What do you mean by that?
-1, My hair looks awful. 
-1, What don't you like about it? 
-1, I just don't like my hair. 
-1, I'm sorry that you don't like it. 
-1, I won't be paying you for this. 
-1, That is no way. 
0, Have you been coming to this Laundromat long?
0, I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago.
0, Why is that?
1, It doesn't cost me as much to wash here.
0, I've just started doing my clothes here.
0, Why are you washing your clothes here now?
-1, My washing machine broke down. 
0, You should just pay someone to fix it.
-1, It's too expensive to get it fixed. 
0, So you're just going to wash here?
0," Yes, I think that's what I'm going to have to do."
1, It costs less to wash here.
0, How long have you been washing clothes here?
0, I started washing here about three years ago.
0, How come?
1, I can wash my clothes for less money here.
0, This is my first time washing clothes here.
0, What reason are you washing here today?
-1, I can't wash at home because my machine is broken. 
0, Go and get it repaired.
-1, That'll cost too much. 
0, Are you going to continue washing your clothes here for a while?
-1, I have no choice. 
1, Washing clothes at a Laundromat costs a lot less money.
0, Do you wash clothes here often?
0, I have been coming here for the past few years.
0, Why do you wash here?
1, It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here.
0, I've only washed my clothes here a couple times.
0, Why don't you wash clothes at home?
-1," I would, if my washing machine wasn't broken. "
0, Why don't you just get it fixed?
-1, I can't afford it. 
0, So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on?
-1, That's my only option right now. 
1," Don't worry. Besides, it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way."
-1, I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer. 
0, What's the problem?
0, I need help turning them on.
0, You need change.
0, The machines take change?
0, Yes. It costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer.
0, How do I do it?
0," You put the coins into the slot, push it in, and it will turn on."
0, That's it?
1, There's nothing else to it.
1, Thank you very much.
1, You're welcome. Let me know if you need anything else.
-1, I need help using the washer and dryer. 
0, Tell me what the problem is.
-1, I can't figure out how to turn them on. 
0, Do you have some quarters?
-1, I didn't know I needed change. 
0, The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar.
0, Where do I put the change?
0, You just put it in the machine.
0, Is that everything that I have to do?
1, That's all there is.
1, I appreciate you helping me with this.
1," If you need anything else, just let me know. I am glad to help you."
0, Could you tell me how to use the washer and dryer?
0, What do you need help with?
0, Do you know how to turn them on?
0, Do you have any change?
0, I need change for the machines?
